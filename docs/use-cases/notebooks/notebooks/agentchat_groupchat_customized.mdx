AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can
be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework
allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to pass a customized agent
selection method to GroupChat. The customized function looks like this:

```python
def custom_speaker_selection_func(last_speaker, groupchat):
    """Define a customized speaker selection function.
    A recommended way is to define a transition for each speaker in the groupchat.

    Parameters:
        - last_speaker: Agent
            The last speaker in the group chat.
        - groupchat: GroupChat
            The GroupChat object
    Return:
        Return one of the following:
        1. an `Agent` class, it must be one of the agents in the group chat.
        2. a string from ['auto', 'manual', 'random', 'round_robin'] to select a default method to use.
        3. None, which indicates the chat should be terminated.
    """
    pass

groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    speaker_selection_method=custom_speaker_selection_func,
    ...,
)
```

The last speaker and the groupchat object are passed to the function.
Commonly used variables from groupchat are `groupchat.messages` an
`groupchat.agents`, which is the message history and the agents in the
group chat respectively. You can access other attributes of the
groupchat, such as `groupchat.allowed_speaker_transitions_dict` for
pre-defined allowed_speaker_transitions_dict.

## Set your API Endpoint

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/api-reference/autogen/config_list_from_json#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-1106-preview"],
    },
)
```

## Construct Agents

-   Planner: Give a plan and revise.
-   Admin: Human in the loop to approve or terminate the process.
-   Engineer: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing code.
-   Executor: Execute the code.
-   Scientist: Read the papers and write a summary.

The pipeline is the following:

1.  The planner interact with Admin (user) to revise a plan. Only when
    the Admin types “Approve”, we can move to the next step.
2.  The engineer will write code to retrieve papers from the internet.
    The code will be executed by executor.
3.  When the code is executed successfully, the scientist will read the
    papers and write a summary.
4.  The summary will be reviewed by the Admin and give comments. When
    the Admin types “TERMINATE”, the process will be terminated.

Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask others to copy and paste the result. Check the execution result returned by the executor.
If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.
