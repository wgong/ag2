Previously, in our [Cross-Framework LLM Tool
Integration](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/tools_interoperability.ipynb)
guide, we combined tools from frameworks like **LangChain**, **CrewAI**,
and **PydanticAI** to enhance AG2.

Now, we have taken AG2 to the next level by integrating the
[`browser-use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) framework.

With `browser-use` ,your agents can navigate websites, gather dynamic
content, and interact with web pages. This opens up new possibilities
for tasks like data collection, web automation, and more.

## Installation

**Warning:** [`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
requires **Python 3.11 or higher**.

To get started with the `browser-use` integration in AG2, follow these
steps:

1.  Install AG2 with the `browser-use` extra:

    ```bash
    pip install ag2[browser-use]
    ```

    > **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you
    > need to do is upgrade it using:
    >
    > ```bash
    > pip install -U autogen[browser-use]
    > ```
    >
    > or
    >
    > ```bash
    > pip install -U pyautogen[browser-use]
    > ```
    >
    > as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI
    > package.

2.  Set up Playwright:

    ```bash
    # Installs Playwright and browsers for all OS
    playwright install
    # Additional command, mandatory for Linux only
    playwright install-deps
    ```

You’re all set! Now you can start using browsing features in AG2.

## Imports

```python
import os

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.tools.experimental import BrowserUseTool
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

-   `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model
    and API key.
-   `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual
    human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
-   `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM
    settings.

> **Note:** [`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use)
> supports the following models: [Supported
> Models](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/supported-models#supported-models)
>
> We had great experience with `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, and `Gemini`.
> However, `DeepSeek` and `Ollama` haven’t performed as well.

```python
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "deepseek-chat",
        "api_key": os.environ["DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"],
        "api_type": "deepseek",
        "base_url": "https://api.deepseek.com/v1",
    }
]

llm_config = {
    "config_list": config_list,
}

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
```

## Integrating Web Browsing with BrowserUseTool

The `BrowserUseTool` enables agents to interact with web browsers,
allowing them to access, navigate, and perform actions on websites as
part of their tasks. It acts as a bridge between the language model and
the browser, empowering the agent to browse the web, search for
information, and interact with dynamic web content.

To see what the agents are doing in real-time, set the `headless` option
within the `browser_config` to `False`. This ensures that the browser
runs in a visible window, allowing you to observe the agents’
interactions with the websites. By default, setting `headless=True`
would run the browser in the background without a GUI, useful for
automated tasks where visibility is not necessary.

```python
browser_use_tool = BrowserUseTool(
    llm_config=llm_config,
    browser_config={"headless": False},
    # deepseek-chat does not support vision yet
    agent_kwargs={"use_vision": False, "generate_gif": True},
)

browser_use_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
browser_use_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

## Initiate Chat

For running the code in Jupyter, use `nest_asyncio` to allow nested
event loops.

```bash
pip install nest_asyncio
```


```python
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

The `user_proxy.initiate_chat()` method triggers the assistant to
perform a web browsing task, such as searching for “AG2” on Reddit,
clicking the first post, and extracting the first comment. The assistant
then executes the task using the `BrowserUseTool` and returns the
extracted content to the user.

```python
result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message="Go to google.com and search for AG2.",
    max_turns=2,
)
```
