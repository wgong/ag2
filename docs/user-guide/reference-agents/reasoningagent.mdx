title: ReasoningAgent
---

`ReasoningAgent` is designed to enhance language models' reasoning capabilities through systematic exploration of thought processes. By implementing the Tree of Thoughts (ToT) framework, it enables LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama to break down complex problems into manageable steps and explore multiple solution paths simultaneously.

Here, we demonstrate the key features and capabilities of the `ReasoningAgent`, showing how it can effectively reason about problems even when using smaller models like `gpt-4o-mini`.

## Search Strategies

The `ReasoningAgent` supports multiple search strategies for exploring the reasoning space:

### 1. Beam Search (Default)
- Maintains the top `k` most promising paths at each step
- Efficient for problems with clear evaluation criteria
- Configurable beam width to balance exploration vs computation
- Special case: DFS mode (beam size = 1) for linear reasoning similar to Chain-of-Thought

### 2. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Balances exploration and exploitation using UCT formula
- Particularly effective for problems with delayed rewards
- Stochastic exploration helps avoid local optima
- Configurable number of simulations and exploration constant

### 3. Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)
- Provides immediate reflection feedback before the next simulation
- Helps identify poor reasoning paths early for future improvement
- Especially useful for complex multi-step reasoning

## Core Components

1. **Thinker Agent**: Generates potential next steps in the reasoning process
2. **Grader Agent**: Evaluates the quality of each reasoning step
3. **Tree Structure**: Organizes thoughts hierarchically for systematic exploration
4. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in Graphviz support for analyzing reasoning paths
5. **Logging Features**: Log and save thinking trajectories to finetune the language model

## Configuration Options

The agent is highly configurable through a single `reason_config` dictionary:

```python
import random

from autogen import AssistantAgent, ReasoningAgent, ThinkNode, UserProxyAgent

# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
config_list = {"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}

verbose = False

question = "What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?"
random.seed(1)  # setup seed for reproducibility

def last_meaningful_msg(sender, recipient, summary_args):
    import warnings

    if sender == recipient:
        return "TERMINATE"

    summary = ""
    chat_messages = recipient.chat_messages[sender]

    for msg in reversed(chat_messages):
        try:
            content = msg["content"]
            if isinstance(content, str):
                summary = content.replace("TERMINATE", "")
            elif isinstance(content, list):
                # Remove the `TERMINATE` word in the content list.
                summary = "\n".join(
                    x["text"].replace("TERMINATE", "") for x in content if isinstance(x, dict) and "text" in x
                )
            if summary.strip().rstrip():
                return summary
        except (IndexError, AttributeError) as e:
            warnings.warn(f"Cannot extract summary using last_msg: {e}. Using an empty str as summary.", UserWarning)
    return summary
```

## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with DFS

The simplest form of tree-based reasoning uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore a single path, similar to OpenAI's O1 feature.
By setting `method="dfs"` in the reason_config, the agent will:
1. Generate one reasoning step at a time
2. Follow that single path until reaching a conclusion
3. Never explore alternative branches

Note: The effectiveness depends on the underlying model's training. Models not specifically trained for step-by-step reasoning
may show limited improvement with this approach.

```python
reason_agent = ReasoningAgent(
    name="reason_agent",
    system_message="answer math questions",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    verbose=verbose,
    reason_config={"method": "dfs", "max_depth": 3},  # Using DFS
    # NOTE: it is equivalent to use beam size 1 for O1-style reasoning
    # reason_config={"method": "beam_search", "beam_size": 1, "max_depth": 3},
)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(reason_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

To determine the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: General Formula

Let's derive the general formula for the expected maximum value of \( n \) rolls of an \( m \)-sided die. The expected maximum value \( E[M] \) can be calculated as:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{m} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]

where \( P(M = k) \) is the probability that the maximum value \( M \) from the rolls is exactly \( k \).

The probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \( k \) is the probability that all dice show values less than or equal to \( k \):

\[
P(M \leq k) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n
\]

Thus, the probability that the maximum is exactly \( k \) can be calculated by:

\[
P(M = k) = P(M \leq k) - P(M \leq k-1) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n - \left( \frac{k-1}{m} \right)^n
\]

For our specific case of \( n = 3 \) rolls and \( m = 6 \) sides, we can substitute these values into the formulas.

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(M = k) \)

Now we'll calculate \( P(M = k) \) for \( k = 1 \) to \( 6 \):

- For \( k = 1 \):
  \[
  P(M = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 - 0 = \frac{1}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 2 \):
  \[
  P(M = 2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 3 \):
  \[
  P(M = 3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 4 \):
  \[
  P(M = 4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 5 \):
  \[
  P(M = 5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 6 \):
  \[
  P(M = 6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Value Calculation

Now we can calculate the expected value using the probabilities:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{216} \)
- \( 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} = \frac{14}{216} \)
- \( 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} = \frac{57}{216} \)
- \( 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} = \frac{148}{216} \)
- \( 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} = \frac{305}{216} \)
- \( 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216} = \frac{546}{216} \)

Adding them up:

\[
E[M] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216}
\]

Calculating the expected maximum value:

\[
E[M] \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \( 4.96 \).

## Beam Search in Tree of Thought

Beam Search is a powerful technique used in tree-based reasoning that allows the agent to explore multiple paths simultaneously. By setting `beam_size` greater than 1, the agent can maintain several candidate solutions at each step, evaluating them based on their potential to lead to the best final answer. This method is particularly effective when the solution space is large and complex, as it balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring that promising paths are prioritized while still considering alternative options.

In this approach, the agent generates multiple reasoning steps in parallel, allowing it to compare different trajectories and select the most promising ones for further exploration. This can lead to more robust and accurate conclusions, especially in scenarios where intermediate evaluations are critical to the final outcome.

```python
reason_agent = ReasoningAgent(
    name="reason_agent",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    verbose=verbose,
    reason_config={"method": "beam_search", "beam_size": 3, "max_depth": 3},
)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False},
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    reason_agent,
    message="Design a mixed integer linear program for a coffee roasting supply chain",
    summary_method=last_meaningful_msg,
)

print(ans.summary)
```
```console
To design a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for a coffee roasting supply chain, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the provided possibilities. The comprehensive steps will involve identifying constraints, decision variables, and an objective function.

### Step 1: Formulate Relevant Constraints
1. **Capacity Limits**:
   - Let \( R \) be the roasting capacity per day.
   - Let \( I \) be the inventory capacity of raw coffee beans.
   - Let \( P \) be the transportation capacity.

2. **Roasting Times**:
   - Each type of coffee bean has a specified roasting time.
   - If \( t_i \) is the roasting time for the coffee type \( i \), then the total roasting time must not exceed available processing time per day.

3. **Raw Material Availability**:
   - Each coffee type \( i \) has a maximum supply \( S_i \) and minimum demand \( D_i \) over a given time period.

4. **Inventory Levels**:
   - Inventory levels should be maintained to meet demand but not exceed capacity.

5. **Supply and Demand Balances**:
   - The supply of roasted coffee must meet customer demand.

### Step 2: Identify Decision Variables
- Let \( x_{ij} \) be the quantity of coffee type \( i \) roasted for destination \( j \).
- Let \( y_i \) denote the amount of inventory for coffee type \( i \).
- Let \( z_j \) be a binary variable indicating whether destination \( j \) is supplied or not.
- Let \( w_i \) represent the quantity of raw coffee beans purchased for type \( i \).

### Step 3: Develop the Objective Function
The objective function could either minimize costs (such as production, storage, and transportation) or maximize revenue. For this example, we will formulate a cost-minimization objective:

\[
\text{Minimize } C = \sum (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij} + C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j + C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
\]

Where:
- \( C_{roast} \) is the cost per unit of roasting,
- \( C_{transport} \) is the transportation cost per unit distance,
- \( C_{holding} \) is the holding cost per unit of inventory,
- \( d_j \) is the distance from the roasting plant to destination \( j \).

### Final Formulation
1. **Objective Function**:
   \[
   \text{Minimize } C = \sum_{i,j} (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij}) + \sum_{j}(C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j) + \sum_{i}(C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
   \]

2. **Constraints**:
   - Capacity constraints:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \leq R \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Roasting time:
     \[
     \sum_{i} t_i \cdot x_{ij} \leq T \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Inventory constraints:
     \[
     Y_i \leq I \quad \forall i
     \]
   - Supply-demand balance:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \geq D_j \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Binary constraints for destinations:
     \[
     z_j \in \{0, 1\}
     \]

With these formulations, you can set up the MILP using an optimization package like PuLP or Gurobi in Python to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
This structured approach provides a foundation for creating a mixed integer linear program that effectively manages a coffee roasting supply chain, accounting for multiple factors such as costs, capacities, and demands.

## MCTS
This section demonstrates how to use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with ReasoningAgent for complex reasoning tasks. MCTS provides several advantages over beam search when:

1. Ground truth evaluation is available
2. LLM-based evaluation is expensive
3. You want to generate diverse, high-quality training data

```python
mcts_agent = ReasoningAgent(
    name="mcts_agent",
    system_message="answer math questions",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    verbose=True,
    # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
    reason_config={"method": "mcts", "nsim": 5, "max_depth": 4},
)

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(mcts_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```

```console
To calculate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use both theoretical calculations and simulations. Below is an outline of how the calculations work theoretically, followed by a brief explanation of how you could validate with a simulation.

### Theoretical Calculation

1. **Probability Distribution**:
   For a single roll of a 6-sided die, the outcomes are equally likely: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each face is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

2. **Maximum Value**:
   Let \( X \) be the maximum value of three rolls of a die. We need to find \( E[X] \), the expected maximum value.

3. **Calculating the CDF**:
   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum of three rolled dice can be calculated as follows:
   - Calculate the probability that the maximum \( X \) is less than or equal to some value \( x \):
     \[
     P(X \leq x) = P(\text{all three rolls} \leq x)
     \]
   The probability that one die is less than or equal to \( x \) is \( \frac{x}{6} \), so:
   \[
   P(X \leq x) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Calculating the expected value**:
   The expected maximum can be derived from its probability mass function (PMF):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} P(X = x) \cdot x
   \]
   where \( P(X = x) \) is obtained from the CDF:
   \[
   P(X = x) = P(X \leq x) - P(X \leq (x-1)) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   Calculate for \( x = 1 \) to \( 6 \):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} \left( \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3 \right) x
   \]
   After calculating \( E[X] \), you will find that:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{91}{18} \approx 5.0556
   \]

### Simulation Approach

1. **Simulate Rolling the Die**:
   - Roll a 6-sided die three times and record the maximum.
   - Repeat this process (e.g., 10,000 times).

2. **Calculate Average of Maximums**:
   After 10,000 simulations, compute the average of the maximum values obtained from each simulation.

3. **Compare Results**:
   Compare the empirical average from simulations to the theoretical expected maximum calculated.

### Conclusion
Using this combination of theoretical calculations and simulations, you can confidently determine that the expected maximum value from three rolls of a 6-sided die is approximately \( 5.05 \). Both the analytical and empirical methods will yield similar results, confirming the correctness of your calculations.

## LATS

It is important to note that our reasoning agent operates based on "process" and lacks direct access to the environment. In contrast, the LATS approach relies on feedback from the environment. To address this, we utilize our existing grader agent to generate pseudo-rewards and provide feedback. The major difference between our LATS implementation and our MCTS implementation is that the LATS approach incorporate the reflection into prompt context before next round of simulation. You can define the agent using the LATS approach as follows.

```python
lats_agent = ReasoningAgent(
    name="mcts_agent",
    system_message="answer math questions",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    verbose=True,
    # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
    reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 5, "max_depth": 4},
)

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(lats_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reason_agent (to user_proxy):

To determine the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: General Formula

Let's derive the general formula for the expected maximum value of \( n \) rolls of an \( m \)-sided die. The expected maximum value \( E[M] \) can be calculated as:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{m} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]

where \( P(M = k) \) is the probability that the maximum value \( M \) from the rolls is exactly \( k \).

The probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \( k \) is the probability that all dice show values less than or equal to \( k \):

\[
P(M \leq k) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n
\]

Thus, the probability that the maximum is exactly \( k \) can be calculated by:

\[
P(M = k) = P(M \leq k) - P(M \leq k-1) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n - \left( \frac{k-1}{m} \right)^n
\]

For our specific case of \( n = 3 \) rolls and \( m = 6 \) sides, we can substitute these values into the formulas.

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(M = k) \)

Now we'll calculate \( P(M = k) \) for \( k = 1 \) to \( 6 \):

- For \( k = 1 \):
  \[
  P(M = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 - 0 = \frac{1}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 2 \):
  \[
  P(M = 2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 3 \):
  \[
  P(M = 3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 4 \):
  \[
  P(M = 4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 5 \):
  \[
  P(M = 5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 6 \):
  \[
  P(M = 6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Value Calculation

Now we can calculate the expected value using the probabilities:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{216} \)
- \( 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} = \frac{14}{216} \)
- \( 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} = \frac{57}{216} \)
- \( 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} = \frac{148}{216} \)
- \( 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} = \frac{305}{216} \)
- \( 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216} = \frac{546}{216} \)

Adding them up:

\[
E[M] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216}
\]

Calculating the expected maximum value:

\[
E[M] \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \( 4.96 \).

\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{216} \)
- \( 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} = \frac{14}{216} \)
- \( 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} = \frac{57}{216} \)

\]

Calculating the expected maximum value:

\[
E[M] \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \( 4.96 \).

reason_agent (to user_proxy):

To design a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for a coffee roasting supply chain, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the provided possibilities. The comprehensive steps will involve identifying constraints, decision variables, and an objective function.

### Step 1: Formulate Relevant Constraints
1. **Capacity Limits**:
   - Let \( R \) be the roasting capacity per day.
   - Let \( I \) be the inventory capacity of raw coffee beans.
   - Let \( P \) be the transportation capacity.

2. **Roasting Times**:
   - Each type of coffee bean has a specified roasting time.
   - If \( t_i \) is the roasting time for the coffee type \( i \), then the total roasting time must not exceed available processing time per day.

3. **Raw Material Availability**:
   - Each coffee type \( i \) has a maximum supply \( S_i \) and minimum demand \( D_i \) over a given time period.

4. **Inventory Levels**:
   - Inventory levels should be maintained to meet demand but not exceed capacity.

To design a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for a coffee roasting supply chain, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the provided possibilities. The comprehensive steps will involve identifying constraints, decision variables, and an objective function.

### Step 1: Formulate Relevant Constraints
1. **Capacity Limits**:
   - Let \( R \) be the roasting capacity per day.
   - Let \( I \) be the inventory capacity of raw coffee beans.
   - Let \( P \) be the transportation capacity.

2. **Roasting Times**:
   - Each type of coffee bean has a specified roasting time.
   - If \( t_i \) is the roasting time for the coffee type \( i \), then the total roasting time must not exceed available processing time per day.

3. **Raw Material Availability**:
   - Each coffee type \( i \) has a maximum supply \( S_i \) and minimum demand \( D_i \) over a given time period.

4. **Inventory Levels**:
   - Inventory levels should be maintained to meet demand but not exceed capacity.

5. **Supply and Demand Balances**:
   - The supply of roasted coffee must meet customer demand.

### Step 2: Identify Decision Variables
- Let \( x_{ij} \) be the quantity of coffee type \( i \) roasted for destination \( j \).
- Let \( y_i \) denote the amount of inventory for coffee type \( i \).
- Let \( z_j \) be a binary variable indicating whether destination \( j \) is supplied or not.
- Let \( w_i \) represent the quantity of raw coffee beans purchased for type \( i \).

### Step 3: Develop the Objective Function
The objective function could either minimize costs (such as production, storage, and transportation) or maximize revenue. For this example, we will formulate a cost-minimization objective:

\[
\text{Minimize } C = \sum (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij} + C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j + C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
\]

Where:
- \( C_{roast} \) is the cost per unit of roasting,
- \( C_{transport} \) is the transportation cost per unit distance,
- \( C_{holding} \) is the holding cost per unit of inventory,
- \( d_j \) is the distance from the roasting plant to destination \( j \).

### Final Formulation
1. **Objective Function**:
   \[
   \text{Minimize } C = \sum_{i,j} (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij}) + \sum_{j}(C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j) + \sum_{i}(C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
   \]

2. **Constraints**:
   - Capacity constraints:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \leq R \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Roasting time:
     \[
     \sum_{i} t_i \cdot x_{ij} \leq T \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Inventory constraints:
     \[
     Y_i \leq I \quad \forall i
     \]
   - Supply-demand balance:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \geq D_j \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Binary constraints for destinations:
     \[
     z_j \in \{0, 1\}
     \]

With these formulations, you can set up the MILP using an optimization package like PuLP or Gurobi in Python to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
This structured approach provides a foundation for creating a mixed integer linear program that effectively manages a coffee roasting supply chain, accounting for multiple factors such as costs, capacities, and demands.

To calculate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use both theoretical calculations and simulations. Below is an outline of how the calculations work theoretically, followed by a brief explanation of how you could validate with a simulation.

### Theoretical Calculation

1. **Probability Distribution**:
   For a single roll of a 6-sided die, the outcomes are equally likely: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each face is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

2. **Maximum Value**:
   Let \( X \) be the maximum value of three rolls of a die. We need to find \( E[X] \), the expected maximum value.

3. **Calculating the CDF**:
   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum of three rolled dice can be calculated as follows:
   - Calculate the probability that the maximum \( X \) is less than or equal to some value \( x \):
     \[
     P(X \leq x) = P(\text{all three rolls} \leq x)
     \]
   The probability that one die is less than or equal to \( x \) is \( \frac{x}{6} \), so:
   \[
   P(X \leq x) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Calculating the expected value**:
   The expected maximum can be derived from its probability mass function (PMF):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} P(X = x) \cdot x
   \]
   where \( P(X = x) \) is obtained from the CDF:
   \[
   P(X = x) = P(X \leq x) - P(X \leq (x-1)) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   Calculate for \( x = 1 \) to \( 6 \):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} \left( \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3 \right) x
   \]
   After calculating \( E[X] \), you will find that:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{91}{18} \approx 5.0556
   \]

### Simulation Approach

1. **Simulate Rolling the Die**:
   - Roll a 6-sided die three times and record the maximum.
   - Repeat this process (e.g., 10,000 times).

2. **Calculate Average of Maximums**:
   After 10,000 simulations, compute the average of the maximum values obtained from each simulation.

3. **Compare Results**:
   Compare the empirical average from simulations to the theoretical expected maximum calculated.

### Conclusion
Using this combination of theoretical calculations and simulations, you can confidently determine that the expected maximum value from three rolls of a 6-sided die is approximately \( 5.05 \). Both the analytical and empirical methods will yield similar results, confirming the correctness of your calculations.

To find the expected maximum value of rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use probability theory effectively.

### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Maximum Value

Let \( X_1, X_2, X_3 \) be the outcomes of the three rolls. We want to find \( E[M] \), where \( M = \max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \).

The probability \( P(M = k) \) of the maximum being equal to \( k \) (where \( k \) ranges from 1 to 6) can be calculated as follows:

1. **Probability that at least one die shows \( k \):**
   \[
   P(\text{at least one die shows } k) = 1 - P(\text{all dice show less than } k) = 1 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

2. **Probability that all dice show \( k \) or less:**
   \[
   P(\text{all dice show } \leq k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3
   \]

Thus, we find:
\[
P(M = k) = P(\text{all dice show } \leq k) - P(\text{all dice show } < k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Present a Clear Formula

The expected value can be computed as:
\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Specific Values

Plugging in the specific \( k \) values (1 through 6):

1. For \( k = 1 \): \( P(M = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216} \)
2. For \( k = 2 \): \( P(M = 2) = \frac{7}{216} \)
3. For \( k = 3 \): \( P(M = 3) = \frac{19}{216} \)
4. For \( k = 4 \): \( P(M = 4) = \frac{37}{216} \)
5. For \( k = 5 \): \( P(M = 5) = \frac{61}{216} \)
6. For \( k = 6 \): \( P(M = 6) = \frac{91}{216} \)

### Full Calculation

Using these probabilities in the expected value formula, we summarize:
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]
Calculating gives:
\[
E[M] = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.96**. The calculations demonstrate the application of both combinatorial analysis and probability theory to arrive at the expected value.

## Use a different Model for Grading

To use a different model for grading instead of gpt-4o, pass the `grader_llm_config` argument when initializing the `ReasoningAgent`. This ensures that the grading of trajectories is performed using the specified configuration from the `config_list`, separate from the main `llm_config`.

```python
# Put your key in the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
grader_config_list = {"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
grader_llm_config = {"config_list": grader_config_list}

writer = AssistantAgent(
    name="Writer",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    system_message="""

    reason_config={"method": "lats", "nsim": 2, "max_depth": 3},
)
```

## Save data to future training
In this section, we will focus on saving the reasoning agent's decision-making data to help future training.

By capturing the structure and content of the reasoning tree, we can create a valuable dataset that can be used to enhance the agent's learning process. This data will allow us to analyze the agent's reasoning patterns, improve its performance, and refine its ability to generate high-quality responses.

The saved data can be utilized for various training methodologies, including supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ultimately contributing to the development of a more robust and effective reasoning agent.

```python
import json

data = reason_agent._root.to_dict()
with open("reasoning_tree.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

# recover the node
new_node = ThinkNode.from_dict(json.load(open("reasoning_tree.json")))  # noqa: SIM115

from autogen.agentchat.contrib.reasoning_agent import extract_rlhf_preference_dataset, extract_sft_dataset

sft_data = extract_sft_dataset(reason_agent._root)
rlhf_data = extract_rlhf_preference_dataset(reason_agent._root)

print(rlhf_data)
```

## Utilizing Ground Truth to Enhance Training Data Generation

Access to ground truth answers allows us to improve the evaluation of reasoning paths. In this section, we will explore:
- The process of incorporating ground truth into prompts
- The methods by which the agent leverages ground truth for evaluation

```python
prompt = """What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?

GROUND_TRUTH:
We define X as the highest outcome among the three rolls.
The probability that X is at least m is 1 - \\left(\frac{m-1}{6}\right)^3 for each m from 1 to 6.
Summing these probabilities gives the expectation E(X) = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} [1 - (\frac{m-1}{6})^3].
Calculating this sum results in E(X) = 6 - \frac{225}{216} = \frac{119}{24}, which approximates to 4.9583.
Therefore, the expected maximum value when rolling a six-sided die three times is \frac{119}{24} or approximately 4.9583.

What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided dice three times?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
reason_agent (to user_proxy):

To determine the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can follow the outlined steps.

### Step 1: General Formula

Let's derive the general formula for the expected maximum value of \( n \) rolls of an \( m \)-sided die. The expected maximum value \( E[M] \) can be calculated as:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{m} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]

where \( P(M = k) \) is the probability that the maximum value \( M \) from the rolls is exactly \( k \).

The probability that the maximum value is less than or equal to \( k \) is the probability that all dice show values less than or equal to \( k \):

\[
P(M \leq k) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n
\]

Thus, the probability that the maximum is exactly \( k \) can be calculated by:

\[
P(M = k) = P(M \leq k) - P(M \leq k-1) = \left( \frac{k}{m} \right)^n - \left( \frac{k-1}{m} \right)^n
\]

For our specific case of \( n = 3 \) rolls and \( m = 6 \) sides, we can substitute these values into the formulas.

### Step 2: Calculate \( P(M = k) \)

Now we'll calculate \( P(M = k) \) for \( k = 1 \) to \( 6 \):

- For \( k = 1 \):
  \[
  P(M = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 - 0 = \frac{1}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 2 \):
  \[
  P(M = 2) = \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 3 \):
  \[
  P(M = 3) = \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 4 \):
  \[
  P(M = 4) = \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{3}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 5 \):
  \[
  P(M = 5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 6 \):
  \[
  P(M = 6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Value Calculation

Now we can calculate the expected value using the probabilities:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{216} \)
- \( 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} = \frac{14}{216} \)
- \( 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} = \frac{57}{216} \)
- \( 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} = \frac{148}{216} \)
- \( 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} = \frac{305}{216} \)
- \( 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216} = \frac{546}{216} \)

Adding them up:

\[
E[M] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216}
\]

Calculating the expected maximum value:

\[
E[M] \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \( 4.96 \).

- For \( k = 5 \):
  \[
  P(M = 5) = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{4}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}
  \]

- For \( k = 6 \):
  \[
  P(M = 6) = 1 - \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
  \]

### Step 3: Expected Value Calculation

Now we can calculate the expected value using the probabilities:

\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} = \frac{1}{216} \)
- \( 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} = \frac{14}{216} \)
- \( 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} = \frac{57}{216} \)
- \( 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} = \frac{148}{216} \)
- \( 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} = \frac{305}{216} \)
- \( 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216} = \frac{546}{216} \)

Adding them up:

\[
E[M] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216}
\]

Calculating the expected maximum value:

\[
E[M] \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately \( 4.96 \).

To design a mixed integer linear program (MILP) for a coffee roasting supply chain, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the provided possibilities. The comprehensive steps will involve identifying constraints, decision variables, and an objective function.

### Step 1: Formulate Relevant Constraints
1. **Capacity Limits**:
   - Let \( R \) be the roasting capacity per day.
   - Let \( I \) be the inventory capacity of raw coffee beans.
   - Let \( P \) be the transportation capacity.

2. **Roasting Times**:
   - Each type of coffee bean has a specified roasting time.
   - If \( t_i \) is the roasting time for the coffee type \( i \), then the total roasting time must not exceed available processing time per day.

3. **Raw Material Availability**:
   - Each coffee type \( i \) has a maximum supply \( S_i \) and minimum demand \( D_i \) over a given time period.

4. **Inventory Levels**:
   - Inventory levels should be maintained to meet demand but not exceed capacity.

5. **Supply and Demand Balances**:
   - The supply of roasted coffee must meet customer demand.

### Step 2: Identify Decision Variables
- Let \( x_{ij} \) be the quantity of coffee type \( i \) roasted for destination \( j \).
- Let \( y_i \) denote the amount of inventory for coffee type \( i \).
- Let \( z_j \) be a binary variable indicating whether destination \( j \) is supplied or not.
- Let \( w_i \) represent the quantity of raw coffee beans purchased for type \( i \).

### Step 3: Develop the Objective Function
The objective function could either minimize costs (such as production, storage, and transportation) or maximize revenue. For this example, we will formulate a cost-minimization objective:

\[
\text{Minimize } C = \sum (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij} + C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j + C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
\]

Where:
- \( C_{roast} \) is the cost per unit of roasting,
- \( C_{transport} \) is the transportation cost per unit distance,
- \( C_{holding} \) is the holding cost per unit of inventory,
- \( d_j \) is the distance from the roasting plant to destination \( j \).

### Final Formulation
1. **Objective Function**:
   \[
   \text{Minimize } C = \sum_{i,j} (C_{roast} \cdot x_{ij}) + \sum_{j}(C_{transport} \cdot d_{j} \cdot z_j) + \sum_{i}(C_{holding} \cdot y_i)
   \]

2. **Constraints**:
   - Capacity constraints:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \leq R \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Roasting time:
     \[
     \sum_{i} t_i \cdot x_{ij} \leq T \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Inventory constraints:
     \[
     Y_i \leq I \quad \forall i
     \]
   - Supply-demand balance:
     \[
     \sum_{i} x_{ij} \geq D_j \quad \forall j
     \]
   - Binary constraints for destinations:
     \[
     z_j \in \{0, 1\}
     \]

With these formulations, you can set up the MILP using an optimization package like PuLP or Gurobi in Python to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
This structured approach provides a foundation for creating a mixed integer linear program that effectively manages a coffee roasting supply chain, accounting for multiple factors such as costs, capacities, and demands.

To calculate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use both theoretical calculations and simulations. Below is an outline of how the calculations work theoretically, followed by a brief explanation of how you could validate with a simulation.

### Theoretical Calculation

1. **Probability Distribution**:
   For a single roll of a 6-sided die, the outcomes are equally likely: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The probability of each face is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

2. **Maximum Value**:
   Let \( X \) be the maximum value of three rolls of a die. We need to find \( E[X] \), the expected maximum value.

3. **Calculating the CDF**:
   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the maximum of three rolled dice can be calculated as follows:
   - Calculate the probability that the maximum \( X \) is less than or equal to some value \( x \):
     \[
     P(X \leq x) = P(\text{all three rolls} \leq x)
     \]
   The probability that one die is less than or equal to \( x \) is \( \frac{x}{6} \), so:
   \[
   P(X \leq x) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Calculating the expected value**:
   The expected maximum can be derived from its probability mass function (PMF):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} P(X = x) \cdot x
   \]
   where \( P(X = x) \) is obtained from the CDF:
   \[
   P(X = x) = P(X \leq x) - P(X \leq (x-1)) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

5. **Calculation**:
   Calculate for \( x = 1 \) to \( 6 \):
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} \left( \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3 \right) x
   \]
   After calculating \( E[X] \), you will find that:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{91}{18} \approx 5.0556
   \]

### Simulation Approach

1. **Simulate Rolling the Die**:
   - Roll a 6-sided die three times and record the maximum.
   - Repeat this process (e.g., 10,000 times).

2. **Calculate Average of Maximums**:
   After 10,000 simulations, compute the average of the maximum values obtained from each simulation.

3. **Compare Results**:
   Compare the empirical average from simulations to the theoretical expected maximum calculated.

### Conclusion
Using this combination of theoretical calculations and simulations, you can confidently determine that the expected maximum value from three rolls of a 6-sided die is approximately \( 5.05 \). Both the analytical and empirical methods will yield similar results, confirming the correctness of your calculations.

To find the expected maximum value of rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use probability theory effectively.

### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Maximum Value

Let \( X_1, X_2, X_3 \) be the outcomes of the three rolls. We want to find \( E[M] \), where \( M = \max(X_1, X_2, X_3) \).

The probability \( P(M = k) \) of the maximum being equal to \( k \) (where \( k \) ranges from 1 to 6) can be calculated as follows:

1. **Probability that at least one die shows \( k \):**
   \[
   P(\text{at least one die shows } k) = 1 - P(\text{all dice show less than } k) = 1 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

2. **Probability that all dice show \( k \) or less:**
   \[
   P(\text{all dice show } \leq k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3
   \]

Thus, we find:
\[
P(M = k) = P(\text{all dice show } \leq k) - P(\text{all dice show } < k) = \left(\frac{k}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{k-1}{6}\right)^3
\]

### Step 2: Present a Clear Formula

The expected value can be computed as:
\[
E[M] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} k \cdot P(M = k)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Specific Values

Plugging in the specific \( k \) values (1 through 6):

1. For \( k = 1 \): \( P(M = 1) = \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{216} \)
2. For \( k = 2 \): \( P(M = 2) = \frac{7}{216} \)
3. For \( k = 3 \): \( P(M = 3) = \frac{19}{216} \)
4. For \( k = 4 \): \( P(M = 4) = \frac{37}{216} \)
5. For \( k = 5 \): \( P(M = 5) = \frac{61}{216} \)
6. For \( k = 6 \): \( P(M = 6) = \frac{91}{216} \)

### Full Calculation

Using these probabilities in the expected value formula, we summarize:
\[
E[M] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
\]
Calculating gives:
\[
E[M] = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.96
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.96**. The calculations demonstrate the application of both combinatorial analysis and probability theory to arrive at the expected value.

GROUND_TRUTH:
We define X as the highest outcome among the three rolls.

To calculate the expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times, we can use the following approach:

### Theoretical Calculation

1. **Maximum of Rolls**:
   Let \( X \) be the maximum value of three rolls of a die. We need to find \( E[X] \), the expected maximum value.

2. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**:
   The CDF, \( P(X \leq x) \), gives the probability that the maximum of the three rolls is less than or equal to \( x \):
   - For a single roll, the probability that a roll is less than or equal to \( x \) is \( \frac{x}{6} \).
   - For three independent rolls, the probability that all three rolls are \( \leq x \) is:
     \[
     P(X \leq x) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3
     \]

3. **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:
   To find \( E[X] \), we need the probabilities \( P(X = x) \):
   \[
   P(X = x) = P(X \leq x) - P(X \leq (x-1)) = \left(\frac{x}{6}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{x-1}{6}\right)^3
   \]

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   The expected maximum can then be calculated as:
   \[
   E[X] = \sum_{x=1}^{6} P(X = x) \cdot x
   \]

5. **Calculation for Each Value**:
   - For \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     P(X = 1) = \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{216}
     \]
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     P(X = 2) = \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{8}{216} - \frac{1}{216} = \frac{7}{216}
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     P(X = 3) = \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{2}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{27}{216} - \frac{8}{216} = \frac{19}{216}
     \]
   - For \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     P(X = 4) = \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{3}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{64}{216} - \frac{27}{216} = \frac{37}{216}
     \]
   - For \( x = 5 \):
     \[
     P(X = 5) = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{4}{6} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{216} - \frac{64}{216} = \frac{61}{216}

     P(X = 6) = 1 - \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^3 = 1 - \frac{125}{216} = \frac{91}{216}
     \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   Putting it all together:
   \[
   E[X] = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{216} + 2 \cdot \frac{7}{216} + 3 \cdot \frac{19}{216} + 4 \cdot \frac{37}{216} + 5 \cdot \frac{61}{216} + 6 \cdot \frac{91}{216}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   E[X] = \frac{1 + 14 + 57 + 148 + 305 + 546}{216} = \frac{1071}{216} \approx 4.9583
   \]

**Conclusion**:
The expected maximum value when rolling a 6-sided die three times is approximately **4.96**.

## Forest of Thoughts

The concept of a "Forest of Thoughts" allows us to leverage bootstrapping techniques to execute the tree of thoughts multiple times, creating a diverse set of answers. After running these independent reasoning processes, we can aggregate them to form our final answer.

```python
forest_agent = ReasoningAgent(
    name="mcts_agent",
    system_message="answer math questions",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    verbose=True,
    # setup small depth and simulations for conciseness.
    reason_config={"method": "dfs", "max_depth": 4, "forest_size": 3},
)

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config=False,
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
)

ans = user_proxy.initiate_chat(forest_agent, message=question, summary_method=last_meaningful_msg)

print(ans.summary)
```
```console
To answer the question "What is the expected maximum dice value if you can roll a 6-sided die three times?", we can summarize various approaches taken by students:

1. **Empirical Simulation**: One student suggested conducting a simulation that rolls a 6-sided die three times across a large number of iterations (e.g., 100,000). They collected the maximum value from each set of rolls and calculated the average of these maximums to estimate the expected value, which converged to approximately 4.96.

2. **Theoretical Probability Calculation**: Another student derived the expected maximum using probability distributions. They calculated the probability of each potential maximum value from 1 to 6 using the formula \( P(\text{max} = k) = \left( \frac{k}{6} \right)^3 - \left( \frac{k-1}{6} \right)^3 \). Summing the contributions of each potential maximum value gave them a theoretical expected maximum of about 4.96 as well.

3. **Cumulative Distribution Function Approach**: A different approach involved using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) to find the probability that the maximum of three rolls is less than or equal to a certain value. By determining \( P(\text{max} \leq x) \) for \( x = 1, 2, \ldots, 6 \) and then calculating the expected maximum as \( E[\text{max}] = \sum_{k=1}^{6} P(\text{max} > k) \), they also validated that the expected maximum was roughly 4.96.

4. **Experimental Verification**: Another student echoed the importance of comparing results from both simulation and theoretical calculations to ensure consistency, reinforcing the conclusion that the expected maximum value when rolling three 6-sided dice is approximately 4.96.

Overall, all approaches led to the same conclusion regarding the expected maximum value, showcasing the robustness of statistical methods in reinforcing understanding of expected values.
