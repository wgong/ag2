In addition to transferring to an agent, you can also trigger a nested chat by using a handoff with [`OnCondition`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/OnCondition). This is a useful way to perform sub-tasks without that work becoming part of the broader swarm's messages and agents.

Configuring the nested chat is similar to [establishing a nested chat for an agent](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/conversation-patterns-deep-dive#nested-chats).

Nested chats are a set of sequential chats and these are defined like so:
```python
nested_chats = [
 {
        "recipient": my_first_agent,
        "summary_method": "reflection_with_llm",
        "summary_prompt": "Summarize the conversation into bullet points.",
 },
 {
        "recipient": poetry_agent,
        "message": "Write a poem about the context.",
        "max_turns": 1,
        "summary_method": "last_msg",
 },
]
```

New to nested chats within swarms is the ability to **carryover some context from the swarm chat into the nested chat**. This is done by adding a carryover configuration. If you're not using carryover, then no messages from the swarm chat will be brought into the nested chat.

The carryover is applicable only to the first chat in the nested chats and works together with that nested chat's "message" value, if any.

```python
my_carryover_config = {
    "summary_method": "reflection_with_llm",
    "summary_args": {"summary_prompt": "Summarise the conversation into bullet points."}
 }
```

The `summary_method` can be (with messages referring to the swarm chat's messages):

- `"all"` - messages will be converted to a new-line concatenated string, e.g. `[first nested chat message]\nContext: \n[swarm message 1]\n[swarm message 2]\n...`
- `"last_msg"` - the latest message will be added, e.g. `[first nested chat message]\nContext: \n[swarm's latest message]`
- `"reflection_with_llm"` - utilizes an LLM to interpret the messages and its resulting response will be added, e.g. `[first nested chat message]\nContext: \n[llm response]`
- `Callable` - a function that returns the full message (this will not concatenate with the first nested chat's message, it will replace it entirely).

The signature of the `summary_method` callable is:
`def my_method(agent: ConversableAgent, messages: List[Dict[str, Any]], summary_args: Dict) -> str:`

Both the "reflection_with_llm" and Callable will be able to utilise the `summary_args` if they are included.

With your configuration available, you can add it to the first chat in the nested chat:
```python
nested_chats = [
 {
        "recipient": my_first_agent,
        "summary_method": "reflection_with_llm",
        "summary_prompt": "Summarize the conversation into bullet points.",
        "carryover_config": my_carryover_config,
 },
 {
        "recipient": poetry_agent,
        "message": "Write a poem about the context.",
        "max_turns": 1,
        "summary_method": "last_msg",
 },
]
```

Finally, we add the nested chat as a handoff in the same way as we do to an agent:

```python
register_hand_off(
    agent=agent_1,
    hand_to=[OnCondition(
        target={
            "chat_queue": [nested_chats],
            "config": Any,
            "reply_func_from_nested_chats": None,
            "use_async": False
        },
        condition="condition_1")
])
```

See the documentation on [registering a nested chat](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent#register-nested-chats) for further information on the parameters `reply_func_from_nested_chats`, `use_async`, and `config`.

Once a nested chat is complete, the resulting output from the last chat in the nested chats will be returned as the agent that triggered the nested chat's response.
