<Tip>
This notebook shows you how to implement a swarm-like orchestration using AG2's group chat.

If you want to get up and running with a swarm faster, we have implemented swarm within AG2, see [this notebook](/docs/notebooks/agentchat_swarm).
</Tip>
</div>


AG2 offers conversable agents, powered by LLMs, tools or a human, that
can perform tasks collectively via an automated chat. Recently, OpenAI
has released a [Swarm](https://github.com/openai/swarm) framework that
focuses on making agent coordination and execution lightweight.

In AG2, the groupchat allows customized speaker selection, which can be
used to achieve the same orchestration pattern. This feature is also
supported by our research paper [StateFlow: Enhancing LLM Task-Solving
through State-Driven
Workflows](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2024-02-29-StateFlow).

In this notebook, we implement OpenAI’s [airline customer service
example](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples/airline) in
AG2 using group chat.


<div class="info Requirements">

## Set your API Endpoint

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/api-reference/autogen/config_list_from_json#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4o"],
    },
)

llm_config = {
    "cache_seed": 42,  # change the cache_seed for different trials
    "temperature": 1,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
    "tools": [],
}
```

## Understand and define the workflow

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[0] }} />

We define a customized agent transition function to decide which agent
to call based on the user input. See the overall architecture of the
example in the image below:

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[1] }} />

<img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/ag2ai/ag2/main/notebook/stateflow-swarm-example.png"  width="700"
         alt="stateflow-swarm-example"> </img>
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: quartoRawHtml[2] }} />

A human user is trying to contact an airline custom service. Given a
request, we will also call `triage_agent` to determine whether it is
lost of baggage or flight modification and route the request to the
corresponding agent. The `Flight_Modificaiton_Agent` is a pure router
that decides whether to call `Flight_Cancel_Traversal` or
`Flight_Change_Traversal` based on the user input.

The `Flight_Cancel_Traversal`, `Flight_Change_Traversal`, and
`Lost_Baggage_Traversal` agents are the main agents that interact with
the user to solve the problem, and call to tools that doesn’t transfer
the control to another agent.

Based on this workflow, we define a `state_transition` function to route
the requests to the corresponding agent.

```python
def state_transition(last_speaker, groupchat):
    messages = groupchat.messages

    # always start with the user
    if len(messages) <= 1:
        return user

    # if the last message is a tool call, return the tool_execution agent
    if "tool_calls" in messages[-1]:
        return tool_execution

    # now, we define what the next agent should be based on the last speaker
    # the best practice is to go through each agent and think about the possible transitions
    if last_speaker is tool_execution:
        tool_call_msg = messages[-1].get("content", "")
        if groupchat.agent_by_name(name=tool_call_msg):
            return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-1].get("content", ""))
        return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-2].get("name", ""))

    elif last_speaker in [flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage]:
        return user
    else:
        # return agent before the user
        return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-2].get("name", ""))


groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    agents=[user, triage_agent, flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage, tool_execution],
    messages=[],
    max_round=20,
    speaker_selection_method=state_transition,
)
manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)
```

## Run the code

> You need to interact with the agents for this example. (You can try
> different inputs to see how they react!)

Here is a sequence of messages entered in this example:

1.  `I want to cancel flight`
2.  `1919` (The flight number)
3.  `I want flight credits`
4.  `No` (No further questions)
5.  `exit` (End the conversation)

```python
def state_transition(last_speaker, groupchat) -> Agent:
    messages = groupchat.messages
    if len(messages) <= 1:
        return user

    if "tool_calls" in messages[-1]:
        return tool_execution

    if last_speaker is tool_execution:
        tool_call_msg = messages[-1].get("content", "")
        if groupchat.agent_by_name(name=tool_call_msg):
            return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-1].get("content", ""))
        return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-2].get("name", ""))

    elif last_speaker in [flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage, triage_agent]:
        return user

    else:
        return groupchat.agent_by_name(name=messages[-2].get("name", ""))


groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
    agents=[user, triage_agent, flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage, tool_execution],
    messages=[],
    max_round=20,
    speaker_selection_method=state_transition,
)
manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config=llm_config)

chat_result = triage_agent.initiate_chat(
    manager,
    message="How can I help you today?",
)
