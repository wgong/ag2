[This](https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2/tree/main/travel-planner) is from AG2's *[Build with AG2](https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2)* repository, find the source files and more use cases there!
</Tip>

Here's a trip planning Swarm, to create an itinerary together with a customer, that you can build upon for your needs. The end result will be an itinerary that has route times and distances calculated between activities.

## Details

The following diagram outlines the key components of the Swarm, with highlights being:

- FalkorDB agent using a GraphRAG database of restaurants and attractions
- Structured Output agent that will enforce a strict format for the accepted itinerary
- Routing agent that utilises the Google Maps API to calculate distances between activities
- Swarm orchestration utilising context variables

## Installation
1. Clone and navigate to the folder:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ag2ai/build-with-ag2.git
    cd build-with-ag2/game_design_agent_team
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The dependency is ag2 with graphrag option.

3. Set up a FalkorDB graph database. Please refer to [https://docs.falkordb.com/](https://docs.falkordb.com/). After the database is running, please adjust FalkorDB host and port accordingly (line 74-75 in `main.py`). A quick way is to set up docker and run this command:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 6379:6379 -p 3000:3000 -it --rm falkordb/falkordb:latest
    ```
    **Note:** You need to have a FalkorDB graph database running. If you are running one in a Docker container, please ensure your Docker network is setup to allow access to it.




## Run the code

### 1. Google Maps API Key

To use Google's API to calculate travel times, you will need to have enabled the `Directions API` in your Google Maps Platform. You can get an API key and free quota, see [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview) and [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/get-started) for more details.

Once you have your API key, set your environment variable `GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY` to the key.

### 2. Set Configuration and OpenAI API Key

Please modify the `config_list` in the `main.py` file (line 35). Read more about configurations [here](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/llm-configuration-deep-dive). This configuration will be used to set up ag2 agents.

By default, FalkorDB uses OpenAI LLMs and that requires an OpenAI key in your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. We will extract the key from the configuration you set (line 49). If you are not using OpenAI in `config_list`, you may comment out the line and read from your environment variable directly.


### 3. Run the code
```bash
python main.py
```

You can now interact with the system through the command line to plan a trip to Rome! You can also modify the initial message to plan a trip to another city.

**Note**: after first run of the code, the db will be initialized and you can switch to `connect_db` in line 82 and 85 in `main.py` for faster rerun.
