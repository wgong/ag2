title: CaptainAgent
---

CaptainAgent is an agent enhanced with the capability to call AutoBuild to break down and solve complex tasks.

AutoBuild can initiate a group chat between a group of experts and converse to solve the task. The experts in nested chat can be retrieved from agent library. The agents can be equipped with tools for advanced coding.

Install AG2 with the CaptainAgent extra.
```sh
pip install ag2[captainagent]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen[captainagent]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen[captainagent]
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

```python
import autogen

config_path = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    config_path, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4o"]}
)  # You can modify the filter_dict to select your model
```

## Using CaptainAgent without libraries

We begin with demonstrating how to use CaptainAgent without retrieving from libraries. In this case, CaptainAgent will automatically generate a set of experts according to its identified subtask and initiate the group chat. By default, the backbone of the LLM is set to `gpt-4o`. For instructions on configuring the backbone, refer to docs on [`nested_mode`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/captainagent/configurations).

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

llm_config = {"temperature": 0, "config_list": config_list}

## build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
    agent_config_save_path=None,  # If you'd like to save the created agents in nested chat for further use, specify the save directory here
)
captain_user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="captain_user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")

result = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    captain_agent,
    message="Find a recent paper about large language models on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    max_turns=1,
)
```

Title: AI-generated Image Detection: Passive or Watermark?
Authors: Moyang Guo, Yuepeng Hu, Zhengyuan Jiang, Zeyu Li, Amir Sadovnik, Arka Daw, Neil Gong
Published: 2024-11-20 18:59:58+00:00
Summary: While text-to-image models offer numerous benefits, they also pose
significant societal risks. Detecting AI-generated images is crucial for
mitigating these risks. Detection methods can be broadly categorized into
passive and watermark-based approaches: passive detectors rely on artifacts
present in AI-generated images, whereas watermark-based detectors proactively
embed watermarks into such images. A key question is which type of detector

Published: 2024-11-20 18:59:52+00:00
Summary: Commercial video generation models have exhibited realistic, high-fidelity
results but are still restricted to limited access. One crucial obstacle for
large-scale applications is the expensive training and inference cost. In this
paper, we argue that videos contain much more redundant information than
images, thus can be encoded by very few motion latents based on a content

Summary: We address the problem of generating videos from unposed internet photos. A
handful of input images serve as keyframes, and our model interpolates between
them to simulate a path moving between the cameras. Given random images, a

Summary: Evaluating the output of Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the most
critical aspects of building a performant compound AI system. Since the output
from LLMs propagate to downstream steps, identifying LLM errors is crucial to
system performance. A common task for LLMs in AI systems is tool use. While
there are several benchmark environments for evaluating LLMs on this task, they
typically only give a success rate without any explanation of the failure

AnalysisReview_Expert (to chat_manager):

I have identified several recent papers related to large language models. Based on their titles and summaries, one of the papers that stands out for its potential application in software is:

**Title:** SpecTool: A Benchmark for Characterizing Errors in Tool-Use LLMs
**Authors:** Shirley Kokane, Ming Zhu, Tulika Awalgaonkar, Jianguo Zhang, Thai Hoang, Akshara Prabhakar, Zuxin Liu, Tian Lan, Liangwei Yang, Juntao Tan, Rithesh Murthy, Weiran Yao, Zhiwei Liu, Juan Carlos Niebles, Huan Wang, Shelby Heinecke, Caiming Xiong, Silivo Savarese
**Published:** 2024-11-20

**Summary of the paper's content:**
The paper discusses the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used in compound AI systems, particularly focusing on tool-use. It highlights the importance of identifying and characterizing errors in LLM outputs, as these errors can propagate to downstream tasks, potentially impacting overall system performance. The authors introduce "SpecTool," a benchmark designed to evaluate and understand LLM errors in the context of tool-use tasks, aiming to provide explanations of failure cases rather than just success rates.

**Potential applications in software:**
- **Error Characterization:** The benchmark can be utilized by developers and researchers to better understand the types of errors LLMs may produce when integrated into software applications, allowing for more effective debugging and refinement of AI systems.
- **Performance Optimization:** By providing insights into error patterns and causes, SpecTool can aid in optimizing the performance of LLM-driven software solutions.
- **Tool-Use Evaluation:** This paper's methodologies can be applied in evaluating LLMs used in various software tools, ensuring reliability and robustness.
- **Development of Advanced AI Systems:** The insights gained from using SpecTool can lead to the development of more sophisticated AI systems that effectively integrate LLMs, enhancing their tool-use capabilities.

This analysis highlights the potential impact of the SpecTool benchmark on enhancing software applications that rely on large language models for performing complex tasks. Let me know if further investigation is needed or any other steps should be taken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: AccuracyVerification_Expert

AccuracyVerification_Expert (to chat_manager):

The chosen paper "SpecTool: A Benchmark for Characterizing Errors in Tool-Use LLMs" seems highly relevant to the task of integrating large language models into software applications, given its focus on error evaluation and tool-use tasks.

To ensure accuracy in our findings:

1. **Backward Reasoning Verification**: Let's consider the implications of potential inaccuracies in tool-use LLMs and verify that SpecTool is indeed addressing these concerns effectively through comprehensive benchmarks rather than just providing a success rate.

2. **Test Case Proposal**: Develop a hypothetical scenario where a software application employing LLMs utilizes SpecTool to evaluate and mitigate errors. Verify whether the framework proposed in the paper can feasibly identify and explain failure cases.

If these steps confirm the potential benefits and applications of SpecTool, we can consider the task complete. Shall we proceed with this verification process to ensure thoroughness?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: AccuracyVerification_Expert

AccuracyVerification_Expert (to chat_manager):

Let's conduct a verification of the effectiveness of the SpecTool benchmark by developing a hypothetical test case scenario:

1. **Scenario Setup**: Imagine a software application that uses a large language model to automate code reviews by providing suggestions for improvements and error corrections. The LLM is integrated into a development environment and evaluated using SpecTool for errors in tool-use contexts.

2. **Evaluation with SpecTool**:
   - Implement a series of automated code review tasks using the LLM.
   - Use SpecTool to benchmark these tasks by analyzing common errors in tool-use, focusing on error propagation and reliability of suggestions.
   - Document each failure case and observe how SpecTool provides explanations and insights into the errors.

3. **Expected Outcome**:
   - SpecTool should identify specific error types in the code review suggestions made by the LLM.
   - It should provide a breakdown of why certain suggestions are incorrect, allowing developers to tweak model parameters or retrain the LLM to enhance performance.

By confirming that SpecTool can effectively provide these insights, we affirm its application in improving software tools that incorporate LLMs. This ensures the benchmark's role in identifying, characterizing, and mitigating errors, thereby optimizing the software's functionality.

If the hypothetical outcomes align with these expectations, it substantiates the paper's potential contributions to software applications. Would this approach suffice for verifying our analysis?

## Building Agents from library & Retrieve tools from tool library
One significant feature of CaptainAgent is that the agents and tools can be retrieved from a dedicated library. When CaptainAgent starts building experts for group chat, it will retrieve and select from agent library, then assign tools retrieved from tool library to the experts.

For agent library, refer to [`captainagent_expert_library.json`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/captainagent_expert_library.json) for samples. You can refer to [docs](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/captainagent/agent_library) on how to customize your own expert library.

For tool library, we provide a set of tools [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/captainagent/tools/README.md), the tools are categorized into three types: data analysis, information_retrieval, math. If you are using the tools, you should [install the requirements](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/autogen/agentchat/contrib/captainagent/tools/README.md#how-to-use) for them.

### Using Agent Library Only

Below is an example that retrieves experts from library and build nested chat accordingly.

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

# build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(

To create a markdown table categorizing the papers into different domains, we need to start by gathering the necessary papers. Here's the plan:

1. **Data Collection**: We'll first need to collect the recent papers on Large Language Models (LLM) applications from arXiv that were published in the last week. Once these papers are collected, we'll move on to categorize them.

2. **Categorization**: We will then categorize these papers into different domains. The domains can be based on the subject matter, application field, or other relevant criteria.

3. **Markdown Table Creation**: Once categorized, we'll create a markdown table that lists each paper under its respective domain.

4. **Analysis for Future Directions**: Finally, we'll analyze these papers to identify future research directions.

Let's first collect the necessary papers by executing a search on arXiv for LLM-related papers published in the last week.

Could you handle the data collection step, please, using the keyword "LLM applications" and filtering for the last week's publications? Once we have the data, I will proceed with categorizing the papers.

arXiv_Data_Collection_Expert (to chat_manager):

Certainly! To collect recent papers on LLM applications from arXiv published in the last week, I'll start by executing a search using the arXiv API. I will filter the results to get only those published in the last week.

Let me write a Python script that performs this task.

'''python
import arxiv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define search parameters
search_query = "LLM applications"
search_limit = 50
date_from = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Search for papers
search = arxiv.Search(
    query=search_query,
    max_results=search_limit,
    sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,
    sort_order=arxiv.SortOrder.Descending,
    start=0,
)

# Collect papers published in the last week
recent_papers = []
for result in search.results():
    published_date = result.published.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    if published_date >= date_from:
        recent_papers.append({
            'title': result.title,
            'authors': ', '.join([author.name for author in result.authors]),
            'published_date': published_date,
            'url': result.entry_id
        })

# Print the collected papers
for paper in recent_papers:
    print(f"Title: {paper['title']}, Authors: {paper['authors']}, Date: {paper['published_date']}, URL: {paper['url']}")

# Returning the collected papers list for further categorization
recent_papers
'''

Let's execute this script to get the recent papers from arXiv.

arXiv_Data_Collection_Expert (to chat_manager):

It seems there was a mistake in the script regarding the usage of the arXiv API. The `arxiv` package doesn't support a `start` keyword. I'll modify the script to remove that and retry the execution.

Here's the corrected script:

'''python
import arxiv
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define search parameters
search_query = "LLM applications"
search_limit = 50
date_from = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

# Search for papers

    query=search_query,
    max_results=search_limit,
    sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,
    sort_order=arxiv.SortOrder.Descending,
)

# Collect papers published in the last week
recent_papers = []
for result in search.results():
    published_date = result.published.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    if published_date >= date_from:
        recent_papers.append({
            'title': result.title,
            'authors': ', '.join([author.name for author in result.authors]),
            'published_date': published_date,
            'url': result.entry_id
        })

# Print the collected papers
for paper in recent_papers:
    print(f"Title: {paper['title']}, Authors: {paper['authors']}, Date: {paper['published_date']}, URL: {paper['url']}")

# Returning the collected papers list for further categorization
recent_papers
'''

Let's try running the script again to collect the recent papers.

DataAccuracy_Expert (to chat_manager):

I can provide some insights on ensuring the accuracy of the categorization and identification of future research directions:

1. **Verification of Domain Categorization**:
   - Ensure that each paper is categorized based on its primary contribution or application domain. For example, papers that explore the use of LLMs for personalizing content should be in the NLP category, even if they employ techniques from other domains.
   - Cross-verify the abstracts of the papers to ensure accurate domain placement.

2. **Review of Emerging Trends**:
   - Identify if there are papers focusing on novel LLM applications that fall outside traditional domains, suggesting emerging fields.
   - Pay attention to methodologies or frameworks that aim to integrate LLMs with other AI technologies, such as reinforcement learning or multi-modal systems.

3. **Future Research Directions**:
   - Consider if there are cross-references in the papers to unresolved challenges or limitations, which can guide future work.
   - Ensure to highlight interdisciplinary potential, especially in fields like healthcare or environmental monitoring, where LLM applications can have significant impact.

4. **Data Integrity**:
   - Double-check any URLs, author names, and publication dates against the original entries to ensure all the information is correct in the markdown table.
   - Verify that the markdown table is well-organized and all columns align properly for better readability and understanding.

Let's ensure each of these points is accounted for before finalizing the results. If needed, we can provide specific test cases or scripts to verify particular details for accuracy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next speaker: Academic_Organization_Expert

Academic_Organization_Expert (to chat_manager):

To address the accuracy points raised by the DataAccuracy_Expert, let's proceed with the following verifications:

1. **Verification of Domain Categorization**:
   - Review the abstracts of the selected papers to verify their primary domains. This will ensure that the classification is based on the core focus of each paper.

2. **Review of Emerging Trends**:
   - Check for papers that introduce new LLM applications or methodologies that may not fit into conventional categories.

3. **Cross-Verification of Information**:
   - Recheck the URLs, authors, and publication dates for accuracy by comparing with the data retrieved from the arXiv results.

4. **Verification of Markdown Table**:
   - Validate the alignment and readability of the markdown table to ensure all columns are consistently formatted.

Let me start by cross-verifying the abstracts and publication details. I'll provide a verification script for checking the consistency of URLs and publication details, assuming these were collected from the arXiv dataset.

'''python
import arxiv

# Define the list of paper URLs to verify details
paper_urls = [
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13485v1",
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13405v1",
    "http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13410v1",
    # Add more URLs as needed
]

# Verify each paper's details
for url in paper_urls:
    paper_id = url.split('/')[-1]
    paper_info = next(arxiv.Search(id_list=[paper_id]).results())
    print(f"Title: {paper_info.title}")
    print(f"Authors: {', '.join(author.name for author in paper_info.authors)}")
    print(f"Published Date: {paper_info.published.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")
    print(f"URL: {paper_info.entry_id}\n")
'''

Would you like me to execute this verification, or is there another specific point of accuracy you wish to address?

To begin the data collection, I'll first provide a Python code to query arXiv for recent papers related to Large Language Models. Once we have the data, I can create a markdown table.

Here is the Python code to retrieve recent LLM-related papers from arXiv:

'''python
import arxiv

def fetch_recent_llm_papers():
    # Define search query parameters
    search_query = "large language models"

    results = arxiv.Search(
        query=search_query,
        max_results=20,
        sort_by=arxiv.SortCriterion.SubmittedDate,
    )

    # Collect paper details
    papers = []
    for paper in results.results():
        if paper.published > start_date:
            papers.append({
                "title": paper.title,
                "authors": ', '.join(author.name for author in paper.authors),

To solve this task, I will follow these steps:

1. **Plan for solving the task**:
   - Since the task involves examining a specific video on YouTube, I will need to watch the video to find the exact moment when the question "Isn't that hot?" is asked and note Teal'c's response.
   - I will then transcribe Teal'c's response accurately.

2. **Constraints and conditions for completion**:
   - The response must be accurate and directly quoted from the video.
   - The task requires accessing and watching the video content.

3. **Execution**:
   - I will watch the video and listen for the specific question and Teal'c's response.

Since I cannot directly access external content like YouTube videos, I will need to rely on experts who can access and analyze the video content. I will seek help from a group of experts to obtain the required information.

APIProcessing_Expert (to chat_manager):

To address the task of determining Teal'c's response to the question "Isn't that hot?" in the specified YouTube video, we can utilize the functionality provided by APIs. We'll proceed with the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Captions**: We'll use the `get_youtube_caption` function to retrieve the captions for the video. This will allow us to search for the specific dialogue in the text format.
2. **Search for the Quote**: Once the captions are retrieved, we will search the text for the question "Isn't that hot?" and find the subsequent response from Teal'c.
3. **Output the Response**: Once identified, we will provide the exact quote of Teal'c's response.

Let's proceed by retrieving the captions for the video:

'''python
from functions import get_youtube_caption

video_id = "1htKBjuUWec"

captions = get_youtube_caption(video_id)
print(captions)  # Print the captions to review and find the specific response
'''

Please run the code above to retrieve the video captions. After obtaining the captions, we can locate and extract Teal'c's response.

# Response from seek_agent_help:
## Task
The task is to examine a video on YouTube and determine what Teal'c says in response to the question "Isn't that hot?". The solution should include accessing the video and accurately quoting Teal'c's response as per the manager's guidelines.

## Results
Teal'c's response to the question "Isn't that hot?" is "extremely".

## Reason for the results
The response was derived by retrieving and reviewing the video's captions using an API function. The caption text indicated that Teal'c's response to the question was "extremely".

## Errors or issues in the conversation
The process seems correct, and the response accurately matches the task requirements. However, the verification relies solely on captions, so there's a potential risk of inaccuracies if the captions are incorrect.

### Need to double-check?
Yes

## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)
- URL of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec
- Code used for retrieving captions:
  '''python
  from functions import get_youtube_caption

  video_id = "1htKBjuUWec"

  captions = get_youtube_caption(video_id)

The initial task was to examine a YouTube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1htKBjuUWec) and determine what the character Teal'c says in response to the question "Isn't that hot?" The experts planned to access the video, locate the specific moment when the question is asked, and transcribe Teal'c's response accurately. They used an API function to retrieve and review the video's captions to find the response. The experts concluded that Teal'c's response to the question is "extremely." This conclusion was verified by accessing the video's captions, which accurately reflected the dialogue. There were no significant errors noted in the process, and the response was consistent with the task requirements.

The ground truth answer to the question is 'Extremely', which the CaptainAgent answers correctly. Notably, with the assistance of tools, the agent can answer video-related questions. This shows the huge potential of what user customized tools can bring.
