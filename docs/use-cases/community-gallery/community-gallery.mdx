## Contributing
Thank you for your interest in contributing! To add your demo to the gallery, please create a Pull Request (PR) with the following details.

  - Updated `website/snippets/data/GalleryItems.mdx` file with your application entry.

  - The application image should be added to the `static/img/gallery` directory if the image is local. If the image is hosted online, just update the `image` property with the URL of the image.

  - Below is an example of an entry in the `website/snippets/data/GalleryItems.mdx` file:

    ```
      {
      "title": "AG2 Playground", // The title of your demo
      "link": "https://huggingface.co/spaces/thinkall/AutoGen_Playground", // URL to your demo
      "description": "A space to explore the capabilities of AG2.", // A brief description
      "image": "default.png", // Filename of the image present in the `static/img/gallery` directory or URL of the hosted image
      "tags": ["ui"] // Tags to categorize your demo
      }
		```
  - Refer to the below table for description of each property:
