As conversational AI evolves, real-time voice interactions are becoming essential in domains like customer support, healthcare, and virtual assistance. AG2 expands its capabilities by introducing [**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent), a powerful agent which enables seamless real-time communication through multiple adapters.

## How RealtimeAgent Works

[**`RealtimeAgent`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/RealtimeAgent) acts as the central component for handling voice-based interactions. It integrates with various adapters, allowing developers to choose the best communication channel for their applications. The agent supports:

- **Real-Time Voice Interactions**: Enables natural and immediate conversations with users.
- **Swarm Integration**: Delegates complex tasks to AG2 Swarm teams during live interactions.
- **Developer-Friendly APIs**: Provides straightforward integration for building real-time AI-driven experiences.

## Available Communication Methods for RealtimeAgent

### 1. WebSocket Audio Adapter
For web-based applications, [**`WebSocketAudioAdapter`**](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agentchat/realtime/experimental/WebSocketAudioAdapter#websocketaudioadapter) eliminates the need for external telephony services, offering:
- **Direct Browser Integration**: Streams real-time audio via WebSockets.
- **Faster Setup**: Avoids Twilioâ€™s complex configuration and account verification.
- **Reduced Latency & Cost**: Bypasses telephony platforms, minimizing dependency on external services.
