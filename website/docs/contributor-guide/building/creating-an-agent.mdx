title: Creating a new agent
---

```python
# Are you wanting to create your own AG2 agent type?
# You're in the right place.
agent = MyFantasticAgent()
```

<Tip>
We'll be getting into the AG2 code-base, it's useful to understand how AG2 works under the hood, [see this section](/docs/contributor-guide/how-ag2-works/overview) for the rundown.
</Tip>

Creating a new agent in AG2 is easy and there are two main approaches you can take.

1. Create and/or use tools as the agent's functionality, keeping the core ConversableAgent functionality pretty much unchanged.
2. Create a reply function as the method for the agent to carry out its internal workflow.

### Tools-based agents

Pros:
- Easier to implement
- Can work well with a small distinct set of tools
- Easy to add another tool
- If you create tools, they can be used by other agents as well

Cons:
- Too many tools may confuse the LLM
- Multiple tool calls can be triggered from one LLM response, this may produce undesired results if the sequence isn't right
- Your agent must have an associated LLM as it needs to recommend tool calls

### Reply-based agents

Pros:
- Most flexibility over how the agent works

Cons:
- More code required, more error handling, more tests
- If using a tool or two is possible, this may be more complexity than necessary
- Functionality encapsulated within the agent, can't be easily used by other agents

## How a tool-based agent is created

Let's take a look at a tool-based agent, the [`DiscordAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/DiscordAgent). You can read more about how it's used [here](/docs/user-guide/reference-agents/communication-platforms/discordagent).

All agents should be based on [ConversableAgent](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent), this makes them usable in all orchestrations.

The DiscordAgent uses two tools to send and retrieve messages for a Discord channel. In addition to [ConversableAgent](/docs/api-reference/autogen/ConversableAgent)'s parameters, it also takes in the authentication and channel details, as well as a boolean to indicate whether writing instructions should be appended to the agent's system message.

Let's look at the code for DiscordAgent with annotations added ([current code here](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/autogen/agents/experimental/discord/discord.py)):
```python
@export_module("autogen.agents.experimental") # Indicates where this appears in the API Reference documentation, autogen > agents > experimental > DiscordAgent
class DiscordAgent(ConversableAgent): # Built on the ConversableAgent class
    """An agent that can send messages and retrieve messages on Discord."""
    # Ensure there's a docstring for the agent for documentation

    DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE = (
        "You are a helpful AI assistant that communicates through Discord. "
        "Remember that Discord uses Markdown for formatting and has a character limit. "
        "Keep messages clear and concise, and consider using appropriate formatting when helpful."
    )

    def __init__(
        self,
        bot_token: str, # Discord specific parameter
        channel_name: str, # Discord specific parameter
        guild_name: str, # Discord specific parameter
        system_message: Optional[Union[str, list[str]]] = None, # We provide the ability to override the system message
        has_writing_instructions: bool = True, # Flag to indicate whether writing instructions are added to the system message
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize the DiscordAgent.

        Args:
            llm_config (dict[str, Any]): The LLM configuration.
            bot_token (str): Discord bot token
            channel_name (str): Channel name where messages will be sent / retrieved
            guild_name (str): Guild (server) name where the channel is located
            has_writing_instructions (bool): Whether to add writing instructions to the system message. Defaults to True.
        """ # Follow this docstring format

        # We set the system message to the passed in value or a default value
        system_message = kwargs.pop("system_message", self.DEFAULT_SYSTEM_MESSAGE)

        # Our two tools, one for sending and one for retrieving
        self._send_tool = DiscordSendTool(bot_token=bot_token, channel_name=channel_name, guild_name=guild_name)
        self._retrieve_tool = DiscordRetrieveTool(bot_token=bot_token, channel_name=channel_name, guild_name=guild_name)

        # Add formatting instructions to the system message
        if has_writing_instructions:
            formatting_instructions = (
                "\nFormat guidelines for Discord:\n"
                "1. Max message length: 2000 characters\n"
                "2. Supports Markdown formatting\n"
                "3. Can use ** for bold, * for italic, ``` for code blocks\n"
                "4. Consider using appropriate emojis when suitable\n"
            )

            if isinstance(system_message, str):
                system_message = system_message + formatting_instructions
            elif isinstance(system_message, list):
                system_message = system_message + [formatting_instructions]

        # Initialize our base ConversableAgent
        super().__init__(system_message=system_message, **kwargs)

        # Register the two tools with the agent for LLM recommendations (tool execution needs to be handled separately)
        self.register_for_llm()(self._send_tool)
        self.register_for_llm()(self._retrieve_tool)
```

### Agent's Tool

Let's look at one of the tools that the agent is using, [DiscordSendTool](/docs/user-guide/reference-tools/communication-platforms/discord), to see how a [Tool](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/Tool) is created (annotations added):

(See the [Creating a Tool](/docs/contributor-guide/building/creating-a-tool) page for a more detailed guide on creating tools)

```python
# Import from 3rd party packages are handled with this context manager
with optional_import_block():
    from discord import Client, Intents, utils

# Some constants
MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH = 2000
MAX_BATCH_RETRIEVE_MESSAGES = 100

# Denote that this requires a 3rd party package, with "discord" being the namespace
# Our AG2 'extra' is called "commsagent_discord"
@require_optional_import(["discord"], "commsagent-discord")
@export_module("autogen.tools.experimental") # Where this appears in the API Reference documentation
class DiscordSendTool(Tool): # Built on the Tool class
    """Sends a message to a Discord channel."""
    # Ensure there's a docstring for the tool for documentation

    def __init__(self, *, bot_token: str, channel_name: str, guild_name: str) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the DiscordSendTool.

        Args:
            bot_token: The bot token to use for sending messages.
            channel_name: The name of the channel to send messages to.
            guild_name: The name of the guild for the channel.
        """

        # Function that sends the message, uses dependency injection for bot token / channel / guild
        async def discord_send_message(
            message: Annotated[str, "Message to send to the channel."],
            # Dependency Injection used to protect information from LLMs
            # These following three parameters won't be used in tool calling but
            # will be injected in when the tool is executed
            bot_token: Annotated[str, Depends(on(bot_token))],
            guild_name: Annotated[str, Depends(on(guild_name))],
            channel_name: Annotated[str, Depends(on(channel_name))],
        ) -> Any:
            """
            Sends a message to a Discord channel.

            Args:
                message: The message to send to the channel.
                bot_token: The bot token to use for Discord. (uses dependency injection)
                guild_name: The name of the server. (uses dependency injection)
                channel_name: The name of the channel. (uses dependency injection)
            """
            ... # code for the sending of a message in here

        # Initialise the base Tool class with the LLM description and the function to call
        super().__init__(
            name="discord_send",
            description="Sends a message to a Discord channel.",
            func_or_tool=discord_send_message, # This function gets called when the tool is executed
        )
```

An important aspect of this tool is the use of AG2's dependency injection functionality. This protects the bot_token, guild_name, and channel_name, from the tool definition for the LLMs, so the LLM will not see the attributes or values. See [Tools with Secrets](/docs/user-guide/advanced-concepts/tools-with-secrets) for guidance.

And, that's all that's needed to create a brand new agent powered by tools.

## How a reply-based agent is created

If tools aren't a viable option for your agent consider a reply-based agent.

<Tip>
It's important to understand how ConversableAgent generates a reply, see [this page](/docs/contributor-guide/how-ag2-works/generate-reply) for more details.
</Tip>

Let's take a look at a basic agent that tells the time utilising a reply function.

```python
from typing import Any, Optional, Union
__all__ = ["TimeAgent"]

# Where our agent appears in the documentation
# autogen > agents > contrib > TimeAgent
@export_module("autogen.agents.contrib")
class TimeAgent(ConversableAgent): # Built on the ConversableAgent class
    """This agent outputs the date and time."""
    # Ensure there's a docstring for the agent for documentation

    def __init__(
        self,
        system_message: Optional[Union[str, list]] = None, # This is how we can use ConversableAgent's parameters
        *args,
        date_time_format: str = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", # This is a parameter that is unique to this agent
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> None:
        """Initialize the TimeAgent.

        Args:
            date_time_format (str): The format in which the date and time should be returned.
        """ # Follow this docstring format

        # This agent doesn't use an LLM so we don't need this, but it's here as an example
        # of how to take in and use ConversableAgent parameters.
        system_message = system_message or (
            "You are a calendar agent that returns the date and time. "
            "Please provide a date and time format for the responses."
        )

        # Store the date and time format on the agent
        # Prefixed with an underscore to indicate it's a private variable
        self._date_time_format = date_time_format

        # Initialise the base class, passing through the system_message parameter
        super().__init__(*args, system_message=system_message, **kwargs)

        # Our reply function.
        # This one is simple, but yours will be more complex and
        # may even contain another AG2 workflow inside it
        def get_date_time_reply(
            agent: ConversableAgent,
            messages: Optional[list[dict[str, Any]]] = None,
            sender: Optional[Agent] = None,
            config: Optional[OpenAIWrapper] = None,
        ) -> tuple[bool, dict[str, Any]]:

            from datetime import datetime
            now = datetime.now()

            # Format the date and time as a string (e.g., "2025-02-25 14:30:00")
            current_date_time = now.strftime(self._date_time_format)

            # Final reply, with the date/time as the message
            return True, {"content": f"Tick, tock, the current date/time is {current_date_time}."}

        # Register our reply function with the agent
        # Removing all other reply functions so only this one will be used
        self.register_reply(
            trigger=[Agent, None],
            reply_func=get_date_time_reply,
            remove_other_reply_funcs=True
        )
```

When we use this TimeAgent in an AG2 workflow it will always return the date and time:

```console
Bob (to time_agent):

Hi Time Agent!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
time_agent (to Bob):

Tick, tock, the current date/time is 2025-02-25 14:05:24.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Where to put your code

Decide on a folder name that matches your agent name, use underscores to separate words, e.g. `deep_research`.

Create your agent code in a folder under [`autogen/agents/contrib/`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/autogen/agents/contrib).

Put the tests for the agent in a folder under [`test/agents/contrib/`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/test/agents/contrib).

If you are creating tools, put them in a folder under [`autogen/tools/contrib/`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/autogen/tools/contrib).

For tools tests, put them in a folder under [`test/tools/contrib`](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/tree/main/test/tools/contrib).

## Documentation

As a way for other developers to learn about and understand how to use your agent, it is recommended to create a Jupyter notebook that:
- Explains what the agent is
- How to install AG2 for the agent (e.g. with extras)
- Has sample codes, simple to advanced
- Notes on capabilities and limitations

As an example, here's the [notebook](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_commsplatforms) for the Discord, Slack, and Telegram tools.

## 3rd party packages

If your agent, or their tools, require a 3rd party package to be installed, add an extra in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file, for example:

```text
twilio = [
    "fastapi>=0.115.0,<1",
    "uvicorn>=0.30.6,<1",
    "twilio>=9.3.2,<10>"
]
```

Put the current version of the packages as the minimum version and the next major version for the **less than** value.

Changes to [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/pyproject.toml) cover `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` packages because they propagate automatically to [setup_ag2.py](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/setup_ag2.py) and [setup_autogen.py](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/setup_autogen.py).

## Tests

It's critical that tests are created for each piece of functionality within your agent or tool.

See this [test file](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/test/agents/experimental/websurfer/test_websurfer.py) for the [WebSurferAgent](/docs/api-reference/autogen/agents/experimental/WebSurferAgent) as an example.

See this documentation for how to run [tests locally and coverage](/docs/contributor-guide/tests).

## Create a Pull Request

We're excited to review and test your agent and tool! Create your Pull Request (PR) [here](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/pulls).

Set the PR as a Draft PR if you're not ready for it to be merged into the AG2 repository.

See our [Contributor Guide](/docs/contributor-guide/contributing) for more guidance.
