    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Solving Tasks Requiring Web Info\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` to perform tasks which require acquiring info from the web:\n",
    "* discuss a paper based on its URL.\n",
    "* discuss about the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. By setting `human_input_mode` properly, the `UserProxyAgent` can also prompt the user for feedback to `AssistantAgent`. For example, when `human_input_mode` is set to \"TERMINATE\", the `UserProxyAgent` will execute the code written by `AssistantAgent` directly and return the execution results (success or failure and corresponding outputs) to `AssistantAgent`, and prompt the user for feedback when the task is finished. When user feedback is provided, the `UserProxyAgent` will directly pass the feedback to `AssistantAgent`.\n",
