title: Tools
---

Agents gain significant utility through tools as they provide access to external data, APIs, and functionality.

In AG2, using tools is done in two parts, an agent *suggests* which tools to use (via their LLM) and another *executes* the tool.

<Note>In a conversation the executor agent must follow the agent that suggests a tool.</Note>

In the swarm example above, we attached tools to our agents and, as part of the swarm, AG2 created a tool executor agent to run recommended tools. Typically, you'll create two agents, one to decide which tool to use and another to execute it.

import Example from "/snippets/python-examples/toolregister.mdx";

<Example/>

1. Here's the tool, a function, that we'll attach to our agents, the `Annotated` parameter will be  included in the call to the LLM so it understands what the `date_string` needs.

2. The date_agent will determine whether to use the tool, using its LLM.

3. The executor_agent will run the tool and return the output as its reply.

4. Registering the tool with the agents and giving it a description to help the LLM determine.

5. We have a two-way chat, so after the date_agent the executor_agent will run and, if it sees that the date_agent suggested the use of the tool, it will execute it.

    ```console
    executor_agent (to date_agent):

    I was born on the 25th of March 1995, what day was it?

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
    date_agent (to executor_agent):

    ***** Suggested tool call (call_iOOZMTCoIVVwMkkSVu04Krj8): get_weekday *****
    Arguments:
    {"date_string":"1995-03-25"}
    ****************************************************************************

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>>>>>>> EXECUTING FUNCTION get_weekday...
    Call ID: call_iOOZMTCoIVVwMkkSVu04Krj8
    Input arguments: {'date_string': '1995-03-25'}
    executor_agent (to date_agent):

    ***** Response from calling tool (call_iOOZMTCoIVVwMkkSVu04Krj8) *****
    Saturday
    **********************************************************************

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    >>>>>>>> USING AUTO REPLY...
    date_agent (to executor_agent):

    It was a Saturday.

    ```

Alternatively, you can use decorators to register a tool. So, instead of using `register_function`, you can register them with the function definition.
```python
@date_agent.register_for_llm(description="Get the day of the week for a given date")
@executor_agent.register_for_execution()
def get_weekday(date_string: Annotated[str, "Format: YYYY-MM-DD"]) -> str:
    date = datetime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d')
    return date.strftime('%A')
```
