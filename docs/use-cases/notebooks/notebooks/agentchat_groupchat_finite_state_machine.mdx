AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans, which
can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This
framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

This notebook is about using graphs to define the transition paths
amongst speakers.

Benefits - This contribution fills the gap between the current modes of
GroupChat Class (auto, manual, round_robin) and an expressive directed
graph. See Motivation for more detailed discussion.

```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install pyautogen[graph]>=0.2.11
```


```python
import random  # noqa E402

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.conversable_agent import ConversableAgent
from autogen.agentchat.assistant_agent import AssistantAgent
from autogen.agentchat.groupchat import GroupChat
from autogen.graph_utils import visualize_speaker_transitions_dict
```


```python
print(autogen.__version__)
```

## Motivation

The current GroupChat class allows transitioning to any agent (with or
without the decision of the LLM), some use cases might demand for more
control over transition. A graph is a possible way to control the
transition paths, where each node represents an agent and each directed
edge represents possible transition paths. Let’s illustrate the current
transition paths for a GroupChat with five agents.

```python
config_list_gpt4 = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "cache_seed": 44,  # change the seed for different trials
    "config_list": autogen.config_list_from_json(
        "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
        filter_dict={"tags": ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-32k"]},  # comment out to get all
    ),
    "temperature": 0,
}
```


```python
agents = [ConversableAgent(name=f"Agent{i}", llm_config=False) for i in range(5)]
allowed_speaker_transitions_dict = {agent: [other_agent for other_agent in agents] for agent in agents}

visualize_speaker_transitions_dict(allowed_speaker_transitions_dict, agents)
```

### Possibly interesting transition paths

1.  Hub and Spoke
2.  Sequential Team Operations
3.  Think aloud and debate

```python
agents = [ConversableAgent(name=f"Agent{i}", llm_config=False) for i in range(5)]
allowed_speaker_transitions_dict = {
    agents[0]: [agents[1], agents[2], agents[3], agents[4]],
    agents[1]: [agents[0]],
    agents[2]: [agents[0]],
    agents[3]: [agents[0]],
    agents[4]: [agents[0]],
}

visualize_speaker_transitions_dict(allowed_speaker_transitions_dict, agents)
```


```python
# Sequential Team Operations
# Create an empty directed graph

speaker_transitions_dict = {}
teams = ["A", "B", "C"]
team_size = 5


def get_agent_of_name(agents, name) -> ConversableAgent:
    for agent in agents:
        if agent.name == name:
            return agent


# Create a list of 15 agents 3 teams x 5 agents
agents = [ConversableAgent(name=f"{team}{i}", llm_config=False) for team in teams for i in range(team_size)]

# Loop through each team and add members and their connections
for team in teams:
    for i in range(team_size):
        member = f"{team}{i}"
        # Connect each member to other members of the same team
        speaker_transitions_dict[get_agent_of_name(agents, member)] = [
            get_agent_of_name(agents, name=f"{team}{j}") for j in range(team_size) if j != i
        ]

# Team leaders connection
print(get_agent_of_name(agents, name="B0"))
speaker_transitions_dict[get_agent_of_name(agents, "A0")].append(get_agent_of_name(agents, name="B0"))
speaker_transitions_dict[get_agent_of_name(agents, "B0")].append(get_agent_of_name(agents, name="C0"))

visualize_speaker_transitions_dict(speaker_transitions_dict, agents)
```


```python
agents = [ConversableAgent(name=f"Agent{i}", llm_config=False) for i in range(2)]
allowed_speaker_transitions_dict = {
    agents[0]: [agents[0], agents[1]],
    agents[1]: [agents[0], agents[1]],
}

visualize_speaker_transitions_dict(allowed_speaker_transitions_dict, agents)
```

## Demonstration

`GroupChat` now takes in two optional arguments. -
allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions: The keys are source agents,
and the values are agents that the key agent can/can’t transit to,
depending on speaker_transitions_type. Default is None, which means all
agents can transit to all other agents. - speaker_transitions_type:
whether the speaker_transitions_type is a dictionary containing lists of
allowed agents or disallowed agents. “allowed” means the
`allowed_or_disallowed_speaker_transitions` is a dictionary containing
lists of allowed agents.

### Team Operations

```python
# Create an empty directed graph
agents = []
speaker_transitions_dict = {}
secret_values = {}

# Outer loop for prefixes 'A', 'B', 'C'
for prefix in ["A", "B", "C"]:
    # Add 3 nodes with each prefix to the graph using a for loop
    for i in range(3):
        node_id = f"{prefix}{i}"
        secret_value = random.randint(1, 5)  # Generate a random secret value
        secret_values[node_id] = secret_value

        # Create an AssistantAgent for each node (assuming AssistantAgent is a defined class)
        agents.append(
            AssistantAgent(
                name=node_id,
                system_message=f"""Your name is {node_id}.
                                          Do not respond as the speaker named in the NEXT tag if your name is not in the NEXT tag. Instead, suggest a relevant team leader to handle the mis-tag, with the NEXT: tag.

                                          You have {secret_value} chocolates.

                                          The list of players are [A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, B2, C0, C1, C2].

                                            Your first character of your name is your team, and your second character denotes that you are a team leader if it is 0.
                                            CONSTRAINTS: Team members can only talk within the team, whilst team leader can talk to team leaders of other teams but not team members of other teams.

                                            You can use NEXT: to suggest the next speaker. You have to respect the CONSTRAINTS, and can only suggest one player from the list of players, i.e., do not suggest A3 because A3 is not from the list of players.
                                            Team leaders must make sure that they know the sum of the individual chocolate count of all three players in their own team, i.e., A0 is responsible for team A only.

                                          Keep track of the player's tally using a JSON format so that others can check the total tally. Use
                                          A0:?, A1:?, A2:?,
                                          B0:?, B1:?, B2:?,
                                          C0:?, C1:?, C2:?

                                          If you are the team leader, you should aggregate your team's total chocolate count to cooperate.
                                          Once the team leader know their team's tally, they can suggest another team leader for them to find their team tally, because we need all three team tallys to succeed.
                                          Use NEXT: to suggest the next speaker, e.g., NEXT: A0.

                                          Once we have the total tally from all nine players, sum up all three teams' tally, then terminate the discussion using TERMINATE.
