AG2 supports `RealtimeAgent`, a powerful agent type that connects
seamlessly to OpenAI’s [Realtime
API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api). With
`RealtimeAgent`, you can add voice interaction and listening
capabilities to your swarms, enabling dynamic and natural communication.

AG2 provides an intuitive programming interface to build and orchestrate
swarms of agents. With `RealtimeAgent`, you can enhance swarm
functionality, integrating real-time interactions alongside task
automation. Check the
[Documentation](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/swarm) and
[Blog](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2024-11-17-Swarm) for further insights.

In this notebook, we implement OpenAI’s [airline customer service
example](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples/airline) in
AG2 using the `RealtimeAgent` for enhanced interaction.

## Install AG2 and dependencies

To use the realtime agent we will connect it to a local websocket
through the browser.

To be able to run this notebook, you will need to install ag2, fastapi,
uvicorn and jinja2.


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
Install `ag2` with additional dependencies to run a fastAPI server:
```bash
pip install "ag2", "fastapi>=0.115.0,<1", "uvicorn>=0.30.6,<1" "jinja2"
```
For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2).
</Info>
</div>


```python
!pip install "fastapi>=0.115.0,<1" "uvicorn>=0.30.6,<1" "jinja2"
```

## Import the dependencies

```python
import os
from logging import getLogger
from pathlib import Path

import uvicorn
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, WebSocket
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse, JSONResponse
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.templating import Jinja2Templates

import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.realtime.experimental import RealtimeAgent
```

## Prepare your `llm_config` and `realtime_llm_config`

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/api-reference/autogen/config_list_from_json#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
swarm_config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4o-mini"],
    },
)

swarm_llm_config = {
    "cache_seed": 42,  # change the cache_seed for different trials
    "temperature": 1,
    "config_list": swarm_config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
    "tools": [],
}

assert swarm_config_list, "No LLM found for the given model"
```


```python
realtime_config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "tags": ["gpt-4o-mini-realtime"],
    },
)

realtime_llm_config = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "config_list": realtime_config_list,
    "temperature": 0.8,
}

assert realtime_config_list, (
    "No LLM found for the given model, please add the following lines to the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file:"
    """
    {
        "model": "gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
        "api_key": "sk-***********************...*",
        "tags": ["gpt-4o-mini-realtime", "realtime"]
    }"""
)
```

## Define Agents and register functions

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, OnCondition, register_hand_off

# Triage Agent
triage_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="Triage_Agent",
    system_message=triage_instructions(context_variables=context_variables),
    llm_config=swarm_llm_config,
    functions=[non_flight_enquiry],
)

# Flight Modification Agent
flight_modification = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Modification_Agent",
    system_message="""You are a Flight Modification Agent for a customer service airline.
      Your task is to determine if the user wants to cancel or change their flight.
      Use message history and ask clarifying questions as needed to decide.
      Once clear, call the appropriate transfer function.""",
    llm_config=swarm_llm_config,
)

# Flight Cancel Agent
flight_cancel = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Cancel_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + FLIGHT_CANCELLATION_POLICY,
    llm_config=swarm_llm_config,
    functions=[initiate_refund, initiate_flight_credits, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)

# Flight Change Agent
flight_change = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Change_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + FLIGHT_CHANGE_POLICY,
    llm_config=swarm_llm_config,
    functions=[valid_to_change_flight, change_flight, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)

# Lost Baggage Agent
lost_baggage = ConversableAgent(
    name="Lost_Baggage_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + LOST_BAGGAGE_POLICY,
    llm_config=swarm_llm_config,
    functions=[initiate_baggage_search, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)
```

### Register Handoffs

Now we register the handoffs for the agents. Note that you don’t need to
define the transfer functions and pass them in. Instead, you can
directly register the handoffs using the `ON_CONDITION` class.

```python
# Register hand-offs
register_hand_off(
    agent=triage_agent,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(flight_modification, "To modify a flight"),
        OnCondition(lost_baggage, "To find lost baggage"),
    ],
)

register_hand_off(
    agent=flight_modification,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(flight_cancel, "To cancel a flight"),
        OnCondition(flight_change, "To change a flight"),
    ],
)

transfer_to_triage_description = "Call this function when a user needs to be transferred to a different agent and a different policy.\nFor instance, if a user is asking about a topic that is not handled by the current agent, call this function."
for agent in [flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage]:
    register_hand_off(agent=agent, hand_to=OnCondition(triage_agent, transfer_to_triage_description))
```

### Before you start the server

To run uviconrn server inside the notebook, you will need to use
nest_asyncio. This is because Jupyter uses the asyncio event loop, and
uvicorn uses its own event loop. nest_asyncio will allow uvicorn to run
in Jupyter.

Please install nest_asyncio by running the following cell.

```python
!pip install nest_asyncio
```


```python
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

# Implementing and Running a Basic App

Let us set up and execute a FastAPI application that integrates
real-time agent interactions.

### Define basic FastAPI app

1.  **Define Port**: Sets the `PORT` variable to `5050`, which will be
    used for the server.
2.  **Initialize FastAPI App**: Creates a `FastAPI` instance named
    `app`, which serves as the main application.
3.  **Define Root Endpoint**: Adds a `GET` endpoint at the root URL
    (`/`). When accessed, it returns a JSON response with the message
    `"WebRTC AG2 Server is running!"`.

This sets up a basic FastAPI server and provides a simple health-check
endpoint to confirm that the server is operational.

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

PORT = 5050


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(*args, **kwargs):
    print("Application started. Please visit http://localhost:5050/start-chat to start voice chat.")
    yield


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)


@app.get("/", response_class=JSONResponse)
async def index_page():
    return {"message": "WebRTC AG2 Server is running!"}
```

### Prepare `start-chat` endpoint

1.  **Set the Working Directory**: Define `notebook_path` as the current
    working directory using `os.getcwd()`.
2.  **Mount Static Files**: Mount the `static` directory (inside
    `agentchat_realtime_webrtc`) to serve JavaScript, CSS, and other
    static assets under the `/static` path.
3.  **Set Up Templates**: Configure Jinja2 to render HTML templates from
    the `templates` directory within `agentchat_realtime_webrtc`.
4.  **Create the `/start-chat/` Endpoint**: Define a `GET` route that
    serves the `chat.html` template. Pass the client’s `request` and the
    `port` variable to the template for rendering a dynamic page for the
    audio chat interface.

This code sets up static file handling, template rendering, and a
dedicated endpoint to deliver the chat interface.

```python
notebook_path = os.getcwd()

app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory=Path(notebook_path) / "agentchat_realtime_webrtc" / "static"), name="static")

# Templates for HTML responses

templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=Path(notebook_path) / "agentchat_realtime_webrtc" / "templates")


@app.get("/start-chat/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def start_chat(request: Request):
    """Endpoint to return the HTML page for audio chat."""
    port = PORT  # Extract the client's port
    return templates.TemplateResponse("chat.html", {"request": request, "port": port})
```

### Prepare endpoint for AG2 backend websocket

1.  **Set Up the WebSocket Endpoint**: Define the `/session` WebSocket
    route to handle audio streaming.
2.  **Accept WebSocket Connections**: Accept incoming WebSocket
    connections from clients.
3.  **Initialize Logger**: Retrieve a logger instance for logging
    purposes.
4.  **Set Up Realtime Agent**: Create a `RealtimeAgent` with the
    following:
    -   **Name**: `Flight_Realtime_Agent`.
    -   **System Message**: Introduces the AI assistant and its
        capabilities.
    -   **LLM Configuration**: Uses `realtime_llm_config` for language
        model settings.
    -   **Websocket**: Used by the RealtimeAgent backend to receive
        messages form WebRTC application.
    -   **Logger**: Logs activities for debugging and monitoring.
5.  **Register a swarm**: Register a swarm to `RealtimeAgent` enabling
    it to respond to basic flight queries.
6.  **Run the Agent**: Start the `realtime_agent` to handle interactions
    in real time.

```python
from autogen.agentchat.realtime.experimental import register_swarm


@app.websocket("/session")
async def handle_media_stream(websocket: WebSocket):
    """Handle WebSocket connections providing audio stream and OpenAI."""
    await websocket.accept()

    logger = getLogger("uvicorn.error")

    realtime_agent = RealtimeAgent(
        name="Flight_Realtime_Agent",
        llm_config=realtime_llm_config,
        websocket=websocket,
        logger=logger,
    )

    register_swarm(
        realtime_agent=realtime_agent,
        initial_agent=triage_agent,
        agents=[triage_agent, flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage],
    )

    await realtime_agent.run()
```

### Run the app using uvicorn

```python
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=PORT)
```
