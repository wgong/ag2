If you're wanting to develop new agents, agent capabilities, or understand the flow of an AG2 workflow, this is the right section for you.

<Tip>
This section involves diving into AG2's source code, if that doesn't sound like what you are after, check out our Basic and Advanced concept sections under [User Guide](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2).
</Tip>

Sections:

1. Chat workflow with [initiate_chat](./initiate-chat)

2. How ConversableAgent generates its reply with [generate_reply](./generate-reply)

3. How to update agent and message state using [hooks](./hooks)
