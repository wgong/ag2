By: [Linxin Song](https://linxins97.github.io/), [Jieyu
Zhang](https://jieyuz2.github.io/) Reference: [Agent
AutoBuild](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2023-11-26-Agent-AutoBuild/index)

AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can
be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework
allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent
conversation. Please find documentation about this feature
[here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

In this notebook, we introduce a new class, `AgentBuilder`, to help user
build an automatic task solving process powered by multi-agent system.
Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple
participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this
task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source
LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and
[Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported
model list
[here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html).

## Requirement

AutoBuild require `autogen[autobuild]`, which can be installed by the
following command:

```python
%pip install autogen[autobuild]
```

## Step 1: prepare configuration and some useful functions

Prepare a `config_file_or_env` for assistant agent to limit the choice
of LLM you want to use in this task. This config can be a path of json
file or a name of environment variable. A `default_llm_config` is also
required for initialize the specific config of LLMs like seed,
temperature, etc…

```python
import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder

config_file_or_env = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"
llm_config = {"temperature": 0}
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_file_or_env, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-turbo", "gpt-4"]})


def start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list, coding=True):
    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(
        agents=agent_list,
        messages=[],
        max_round=12,
        allow_repeat_speaker=agent_list[:-1] if coding is True else agent_list,
    )
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(
        groupchat=group_chat,
        llm_config={"config_list": config_list, **llm_config},
    )
    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)
```

## Step 2: create a AgentBuilder

Create a `AgentBuilder` with the specified `config_path_or_env`.
AgentBuilder will use `gpt-4` in default to complete the whole process,
you can specify the `builder_model` and `agent_model` to other OpenAI
model to match your task. You can also specify an open-source LLM
supporting by vLLM and FastChat, see blog for more details.

```python
builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model=["gpt-4-turbo"], agent_model=["gpt-4-turbo"]
)
```

## Step 3: specify a building task

Specify a building task with a general description. Building task will
help build manager (a LLM) decide what agents should be built.

```python
building_task = "Generate some agents that can find papers on arxiv by programming and analyzing them in specific domains related to computer science and medical science."
```

## Step 4: build group chat agents

Use `build()` to let build manager (the specified `builder_model`)
complete the group chat agents generation. If you think coding is
necessary in your task, you can use `coding=True` to add a user proxy
(an automatic code interpreter) into the agent list, like:

```python
builder.build(building_task, default_llm_config, coding=True)
```

If `coding` is not specified, AgentBuilder will determine on its own
whether the user proxy should be added or not according to the task.

```python
agent_list, agent_configs = builder.build(building_task, llm_config)
```

## Step 5: execute task

Let agents generated in `build()` to complete the task collaboratively
in a group chat.

```python
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
    coding=agent_configs["coding"],
)
```

## Step 6 (Optional): clear all agents and prepare for the next task

You can clear all agents generated in this task by the following code if
your task is completed or the next task is largely different from the
current task. If the agent’s backbone is an open-source LLM, this
process will also shut down the endpoint server. If necessary, you can
use `recycle_endpoint=False` to retain the previous open-source LLMs’
endpoint server.

```python
builder.clear_all_agents(recycle_endpoint=True)
```

## Save & load configs 

You can save all necessary information of the built group chat agents.
Here is a case for those agents generated in the above task:

```json
{
    "building_task": "Generate some agents that can find papers on arxiv by programming and analyzing them in specific domains related to computer science and medical science.",

AgentBuilder will create agents with those information without prompting
the builder manager.
