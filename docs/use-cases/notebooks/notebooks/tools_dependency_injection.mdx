[Dependency
Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a
secure way to connect external functions to agents without exposing
sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal information. This
approach ensures that sensitive information remains protected while
still allowing agents to perform their tasks effectively, even when
working with large language models (LLMs).

In this guide, we’ll explore how to build secure workflows that handle
sensitive data safely.

As an example, we’ll create an agent that retrieves user’s account
balance. The best part is that sensitive data like username and password
are never shared with the LLM. Instead, it’s securely injected directly
into the function at runtime, keeping it safe while maintaining seamless
functionality.

## Why Dependency Injection Is Essential

Here’s why dependency injection is a game-changer for secure LLM
workflows:

-   **Enhanced Security**: Your sensitive data is never directly exposed
    to the LLM.
-   **Simplified Development**: Secure data can be seamlessly accessed
    by functions without requiring complex configurations.
-   **Unmatched Flexibility**: It supports safe integration of diverse
    workflows, allowing you to scale and adapt with ease.

In this guide, we’ll explore how to set up dependency injection and
build secure workflows. Let’s dive in!

## Installation

To install `AG2`, simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install ag2
```

> **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you
> need to do is upgrade it using:
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U autogen
> ```
>
> or
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U pyautogen
> ```
>
> as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI
> package.

### Imports

The functionality demonstrated in this guide is located in the
`autogen.tools.dependency_injection` module. This module provides key
components for dependency injection:

-   `BaseContext`: abstract base class used to define and encapsulate
    data contexts, such as user account information, which can then be
    injected into functions or agents securely.
-   `Depends`: a function used to declare and inject dependencies,
    either from a context (like `BaseContext`) or a function, ensuring
    sensitive data is provided securely without direct exposure.

```python
import os
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from pydantic import BaseModel

from autogen import GroupChat, GroupChatManager
from autogen.agentchat import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.tools.dependency_injection import BaseContext, Depends
```

### Define a BaseContext Class

We start by defining a `BaseContext` class for accounts. This will act
as the base structure for dependency injection. By using this approach,
sensitive information like usernames and passwords is never exposed to
the LLM.

```python
class Account(BaseContext, BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
    currency: Literal["USD", "EUR"] = "USD"


alice_account = Account(username="alice", password="password123")
bob_account = Account(username="bob", password="password456")

account_ballace_dict = {
    (alice_account.username, alice_account.password): 300,
    (bob_account.username, bob_account.password): 200,
}
```

### Helper Functions

To ensure that the provided account is valid and retrieve its balance,
we create two helper functions.

```python
def _verify_account(account: Account):
    if (account.username, account.password) not in account_ballace_dict:
        raise ValueError("Invalid username or password")


def _get_balance(account: Account):
    _verify_account(account)
    return f"Your balance is {account_ballace_dict[(account.username, account.password)]}{account.currency}"
```

#### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

-   `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model
    and API key.
-   `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual
    human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
-   `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM
    settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

assistant = ConversableAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy_1",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    llm_config=False,
)
```

### Injecting a BaseContext Parameter

In the example below we register the function and use dependency
injection to automatically inject the bob_account Account object into
the function. This `account` parameter will not be visible to the LLM.

**Note:** You can also use `account: Account = Depends(bob_account)` as
an alternative syntax.

```python
@user_proxy.register_for_execution()
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Get the balance of the account")
def get_balance_1(
    # Account which will be injected to the function
    account: Annotated[Account, Depends(bob_account)],
    # It is also possible to use the following syntax to define the dependency
    # account: Account = Depends(bob_account),
) -> str:
    return _get_balance(account)
```

Finally, we initiate a chat to retrieve the balance.

```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Get the user's account balance", max_turns=2)
```

## Injecting Parameters Without BaseContext

Sometimes, you might not want to use `BaseContext`. Here’s how to inject
simple parameters directly.

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

-   `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model
    and API key.
-   `UserProxyAgent` simulates user inputs without requiring actual
    human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
-   `AssistantAgent` represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM
    settings.

```python
config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]
assistant = ConversableAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy_1",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    llm_config=False,
)
```

### Register the Function with Direct Parameter Injection

Instead of injecting a full context like `Account`, you can directly
inject individual parameters, such as the username and password, into a
function. This allows for more granular control over the data injected
into the function, and still ensures that sensitive information is
managed securely.

Here’s how you can set it up:

```python
def get_username() -> str:
    return "bob"


def get_password() -> str:
    return "password456"


@user_proxy.register_for_execution()
@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Get the balance of the account")
def get_balance_2(
    username: Annotated[str, Depends(get_username)],
    password: Annotated[str, Depends(get_password)],
    # or use lambdas
    # username: Annotated[str, Depends(lambda: "bob")],
    # password: Annotated[str, Depends(lambda: "password456")],
) -> str:
    account = Account(username=username, password=password)
    return _get_balance(account)
```

### Initiate the Chat

As before, initiate a chat to test the function.

```python
user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="Get users balance", max_turns=2)
```

## Aligning Contexts to Agents

You can match specific dependencies, such as 3rd party system
credentials, with specific agents by using tools with dependency
injection.

In this example we have 2 external systems and have 2 related login
credentials. We don’t want or need the LLM to be aware of these
credentials.

### Mock third party systems

```python
# Mock third party system functions
# Imagine that these use the username and password to authenticate


def weather_api_call(username: str, password: str, location: str) -> str:
    print(f"Accessing third party Weather System using username {username}")
    return "It's sunny and 40 degrees Celsius in Sydney, Australia."


def my_ticketing_system_availability(username: str, password: str, concert: str) -> bool:
    print(f"Accessing third party Ticketing System using username {username}")
    return False
```

### Create Agents

```python
weather_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="weather_agent",
    system_message="You are a Weather Agent, you can only get the weather.",
    description="Weather Agent solely used for getting weather.",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)

ticket_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="ticket_agent",
    system_message="You are a Ticketing Agent, you can only get ticket availability.",
    description="Ticketing Agent solely used for getting ticket availability.",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
)
user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy_1",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    llm_config=False,
)
```

### Create BaseContext class for credentials

```python
# We create a class based on BaseContext
class ThirdPartyCredentials(BaseContext, BaseModel):
    username: str
    password: str
```

### Create Credentials and Functions with Dependency Injection

```python
# Weather API
weather_account = ThirdPartyCredentials(username="ag2weather", password="wbkvEehV1A")


@user_proxy.register_for_execution()
@weather_agent.register_for_llm(description="Get the weather for a location")
def get_weather(
    location: str,
    credentials: Annotated[ThirdPartyCredentials, Depends(weather_account)],
) -> str:
    # Access the Weather API using the credentials
    return weather_api_call(username=credentials.username, password=credentials.password, location=location)


# Ticketing System
ticket_system_account = ThirdPartyCredentials(username="ag2tickets", password="EZRIVeVWvA")


@user_proxy.register_for_execution()
@ticket_agent.register_for_llm(description="Get the availability of tickets for a concert")
def tickets_available(
    concert_name: str,
    credentials: Annotated[ThirdPartyCredentials, Depends(ticket_system_account)],
) -> bool:
    return my_ticketing_system_availability(
        username=credentials.username, password=credentials.password, concert=concert_name
    )
```

### Create Group Chat and run

```python
groupchat = GroupChat(agents=[user_proxy, weather_agent, ticket_agent], messages=[], max_round=5)
manager = GroupChatManager(groupchat=groupchat, llm_config={"config_list": config_list})

message = (
    "Start by getting the weather for Sydney, Australia, and follow that up by checking "
    "if there are tickets for the 'AG2 Live' concert."
)
user_proxy.initiate_chat(manager, message=message, max_turns=1)
```
