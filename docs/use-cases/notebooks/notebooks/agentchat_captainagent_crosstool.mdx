In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to integrate LLM tools from
[LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools),
[CrewAI Tools](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main) into
CaptainAgent. The developers just need to use one line of code to
convert them into [AG2
tools](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_interoperability),
and then pass it to CaptainAgent while instantiation, simple as that.

## Langchain Tool Integration

Langchain readily provides a number of tools at hand. These tools can be
integrated into AG2 framework through interoperability.

### Installation

To integrate LangChain tools into the AG2 framework, install the
required dependencies:

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-langchain]
```

> **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you
> need to do is upgrade it using:
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U autogen[interop-langchain]
> ```
>
> or
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U pyautogen[interop-langchain]
> ```
>
> as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI
> package.

Additionally, this notebook uses LangChain’s [DuckDuckGo Search
Tool](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg/), which
requires the `duckduckgo-search` package. Install it with:

```bash
pip install duckduckgo-search
```

### Preparation

Import necessary modules and tools. -
[DuckDuckGoSearchRun](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/tools/langchain_community.tools.ddg_search.tool.DuckDuckGoSearchRun.html)
and
[DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/utilities/langchain_community.utilities.duckduckgo_search.DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper.html#langchain_community.utilities.duckduckgo_search.DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper):
Tools for querying DuckDuckGo. - `Interoperability`: This module acts as
a bridge, making it easier to integrate LangChain tools with AG2’s
architecture.

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun
from langchain_community.utilities import DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper

from autogen.interop import Interoperability
```

### Configure the agents

Load the config for LLM, which include API key and model.

```python
import autogen

config_path = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_path, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4o"]})
llm_config = {"temperature": 0, "config_list": config_list}
```

### Tool Integration

We use `Interoperability` to convert the LangChain tool into a format
compatible with the AG2 framework.

```python
interop = Interoperability()

api_wrapper = DuckDuckGoSearchAPIWrapper()
langchain_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun(api_wrapper=api_wrapper)
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=langchain_tool, type="langchain")
```

Then add the tools to CaptainAgent, the main difference from original
CaptainAgent initialization is to pass the tool as a list into the
`tool_lib` argument. This will let the agents within the nested chat
created by CaptainAgent all equipped with the tools. THey can write
python code to call the tools and observe the results.

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

# build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
    agent_lib="captainagent_expert_library.json",
    tool_lib=[ag2_tool],  # The main difference lies here: we pass the converted tool to the agent
    agent_config_save_path=None,
)
captain_user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="captain_user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
```


```python
res = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    captain_agent,
    message="Call a group of experts and search for the word of the day Merriham Webster December 26, 2024",
)
```

## CrewAI Tool Integration

CrewAI also provides a variety of powerful tools designed for tasks such
as web scraping, search, code interpretation, and more. The full list of
available tools in CrewAI can be observed
[here](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-tools/tree/main).

### Installation

Install the required packages for integrating CrewAI tools into the AG2
framework. This ensures all dependencies for both frameworks are
installed.

```bash
pip install ag2[interop-crewai]
```

> **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you
> need to do is upgrade it using:
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U autogen[interop-crewai]
> ```
>
> or
>
> ```bash
> pip install -U pyautogen[interop-crewai]
> ```
>
> as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI
> package.

### Tool Integration

Integrating CrewAI tools into AG2 framework follows a similar pipeline
as shown below.

```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapeWebsiteTool

from autogen.interop import Interoperability

interop = Interoperability()
crewai_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()
ag2_tool = interop.convert_tool(tool=crewai_tool, type="crewai")
```

### Adding tools to CaptainAgent

The process is identical to the above, pass the converted tool to
`tool_lib` argument, and all the agents created by CaptainAgent gets
access to the tools.

```python
from autogen import UserProxyAgent
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.captainagent import CaptainAgent

# build agents
captain_agent = CaptainAgent(
    name="captain_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
    code_execution_config={"use_docker": False, "work_dir": "groupchat"},
    agent_lib="captainagent_expert_library.json",
    tool_lib=[ag2_tool],
    agent_config_save_path=None,  # If you'd like to save the created agents in nested chat for further use, specify the save directory here
)
captain_user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="captain_user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
```


```python
message = "Call experts and Scrape the website https://ag2.ai/, analyze the content and summarize it"
result = captain_user_proxy.initiate_chat(captain_agent, message=message)
```


```python
print(result.summary)
```
