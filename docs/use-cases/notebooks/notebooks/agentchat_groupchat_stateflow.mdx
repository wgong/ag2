AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can
be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. In this
notebook, we introduce how to use groupchat to build workflows with AG2
agents from a state-oriented perspective.


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
Install `pyautogen`:
```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2).

## Set your API Endpoint

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/api-reference/autogen/config_list_from_json#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "tags": ["gpt-4", "gpt-4-32k"],
    },
)
```

## A workflow for research

We define the following agents: - Initializer: Start the workflow by
sending a task. - Coder: Retrieve papers from the internet by writing
code. - Executor: Execute the code. - Scientist: Read the papers and
write a summary.

In the Figure, we define a simple workflow for research with 4 states:
Init, Retrieve, Research and End. Within each state, we will call
different agents to perform the tasks. - Init: We use the initializer to
start the workflow. - Retrieve: We will first call the coder to write
code and then call the executor to execute the code. - Research: We will
call the scientist to read the papers and write a summary. - End: We
will end the workflow.

Through customizing the speaker selection method, we can easily realize
the state-oriented workflow by defining the transitions between
different agents.

```python
import tempfile

from autogen.coding import LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor

temp_dir = tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()
executor = LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor(
    timeout=10,  # Timeout for each code execution in seconds.
    work_dir=temp_dir.name,  # Use the temporary directory to store the code files.
)

gpt4_config = {
    "cache_seed": False,  # change the cache_seed for different trials
    "temperature": 0,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
}

initializer = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="Init",
    code_execution_config=False,
)


coder = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="Retrieve_Action_1",
    llm_config=gpt4_config,
    system_message="""You are the Coder. Given a topic, write code to retrieve related papers from the arXiv API, print their title, authors, abstract, and link.
You write python/shell code to solve tasks. Wrap the code in a code block that specifies the script type. The user can't modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires others to modify. Don't use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the executor.
Don't include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask others to copy and paste the result. Check the execution result returned by the executor.
If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.
