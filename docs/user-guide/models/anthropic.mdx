Anthropic's Claude is a family of large language models developed by Anthropic and designed to revolutionize the way you interact with AI. Claude excels at a wide variety of tasks involving language, reasoning, analysis, coding, and more. The models are highly capable, easy to use, and can be customized to suit your needs.

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use Anthropic Claude model for AgentChat in AG2.

## Features

- Function/tool calling
- Structured Outputs ([Notebook example](/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/agentchat_structured_outputs))
- Token usage and cost correctly as per Anthropic's API costs (as of December 2024)

## Requirements
To use Anthropic Claude with AG2, first you need to install the `ag2[anthropic]` package.

To try out the function call feature of Claude model, you need to install `anthropic>=0.23.1`.

# If you need to install AG2 with Anthropic
```bash
pip install ag2["anthropic"]
```

<Tip>
If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
```bash
pip install -U autogen["anthropic"]
```
or
```bash
pip install -U pyautogen["anthropic"]
```
as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
</Tip>

## Set the config for the Anthropic API

You can add any parameters that are needed for the custom model loading in the same configuration list.

It is important to add the `api_type` field and set it to a string that corresponds to the client type used: `anthropic`.

Example:
```
[
    {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        "api_key": "your Anthropic API Key goes here",
        "api_type": "anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model": "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
        "api_key": "your Anthropic API Key goes here",
        "api_type": "anthropic",
        "temperature": 0.5,
        "top_p": 0.2, # Note: It is recommended to set temperature or top_p but not both.
        "max_tokens": 10000,
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-3-opus-20240229",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-2.0",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-2.1",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
    {
        "model":"claude-3.0-haiku",
        "api_key":"your api key",
        "api_type":"anthropic",
    },
]
```

### Alternative

As an alternative to the api_key key and value in the config, you can set the environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to your Anthropic API key.

Linux/Mac:
```
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your Anthropic API key here"
```
Windows:
```
set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
```

```python
import os

from typing_extensions import Annotated

import autogen

config_list_claude = [
    {
        # Choose your model name.
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
        # You need to provide your API key here.
        "api_key": os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
        "api_type": "anthropic",
    }
]
```

### Alternative Anthropic VertexAI Client (GCP)

To use the Anthropic VertexAI client in AG2, you need to configure it for use with Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Ensure you have the necessary project credentials and install the required package.

Configuration

The following configuration example demonstrates how to set up Anthropic VertexAI:

```python
import os

config_list_vertexai = [
    {
        "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0",
        "gcp_project_id": "your_project_id",
        "gcp_region": "us-west-2",  # Replace with your GCP region
        "gcp_auth_token": None,  # Optional: If not passed, Google Default Authentication will be used
        "api_type": "anthropic",
    }
]

assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    "assistant",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list_vertexai,
    },
)
```

### Alternative Anthropic VertexAI Client (Google Default Authentication)

If the `gcp_auth_token` is not provided in the configuration, the client will use Googleâ€™s default authentication mechanism. This requires the appropriate credentials to be configured in your environment, such as:

- Service account key: You can set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to point to your service account key file.
- Cloud Shell or GCP Compute Engine: When running in a GCP-managed environment, default authentication is automatically applied.


Example of setting up the environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
```

This allows seamless integration without explicitly specifying the authentication token in your code.

## Two-agent Coding Example

### Construct Agents

Construct a simple conversation between a User proxy and an ConversableAgent based on Claude-3 model.

```python
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    "assistant",
    llm_config={
        "config_list": config_list_claude,
    },
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    "user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "coding",
        "use_docker": False,
    },
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") and x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=1,
)

user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    assistant, message="Write a python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence."
)
```
```console
user_proxy (to assistant):

Write a python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Certainly! I'll write a Python program to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. Here's the code:

'''python
# filename: fibonacci.py

def fibonacci(n):
    fib_sequence = [0, 1]

    while len(fib_sequence) < n:
        next_number = fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2]
        fib_sequence.append(next_number)

    return fib_sequence

# Print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
n = 10
result = fibonacci(n)
print(f"The first {n} numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:")
print(result)
'''

This program does the following:

1. We define a function called `fibonacci` that takes an argument `n`, which is the number of Fibonacci numbers we want to generate.
2. We initialize the `fib_sequence` list with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence: 0 and 1.
3. We use a while loop to generate subsequent numbers in the sequence by adding the last two numbers until we have `n` numbers in the sequence.
4. We return the complete Fibonacci sequence.
5. Outside the function, we set `n = 10` to get the first 10 numbers.
6. We call the `fibonacci` function with `n = 10` and store the result in the `result` variable.
7. Finally, we print the result.

Let's run this code and see the output. The code will be saved in a file named "fibonacci.py". You can execute it using Python.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>>>> EXECUTING CODE BLOCK 0 (inferred language is python)...
user_proxy (to assistant):

exitcode: 0 (execution succeeded)
Code output:
The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to user_proxy):

Excellent! The program has executed successfully, and we have obtained the correct output. Let's verify the result:

The first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are indeed:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

This is correct because:
1. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.
2. Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
3. We can verify this by checking a few numbers:
   - 1 = 0 + 1
   - 2 = 1 + 1
   - 3 = 1 + 2
   - 5 = 2 + 3
   - 8 = 3 + 5
   and so on...

The program has successfully generated and printed the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The task is completed correctly.
