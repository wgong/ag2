AG2 supports **RealtimeAgent**, a powerful agent type that connects
seamlessly to OpenAI’s [Realtime
API](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-realtime-api). With
RealtimeAgent, you can add voice interaction and listening capabilities
to your swarms, enabling dynamic and natural communication.

AG2 provides an intuitive programming interface to build and orchestrate
swarms of agents. With RealtimeAgent, you can enhance swarm
functionality, integrating real-time interactions alongside task
automation. Check the
[Documentation](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/topics/swarm) and
[Blog](https://docs.ag2.ai/blog/2024-11-17-Swarm) for further insights.

In this notebook, we implement OpenAI’s [airline customer service
example](https://github.com/openai/swarm/tree/main/examples/airline) in
AG2 using the RealtimeAgent for enhanced interaction.

<Note>
This notebook has been updated as swarms can now accommodate any ConversableAgent.

## Install AG2 with twilio dependencies

To use the realtime agent we will connect it to twilio service, this
tutorial was inspired by [twilio
tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/blog/voice-ai-assistant-openai-realtime-api-node)
for connecting to OpenAPI real-time agent.

We have prepared a `TwilioAdapter` to enable you to connect your
realtime agent to twilio service.

To be able to run this notebook, you will need to install ag2 with
additional realtime and twilio dependencies.


<div class="info Requirements">
<Info>
Install `ag2`:
```bash
pip install "ag2[twilio]"
```

For more information, please refer to the [installation guide](/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/installing-ag2).
</Info>
</div>


```python
# !pip install "ag2[twilio]"
```

## Prepare your `llm_config` and `realtime_llm_config`

The
[`config_list_from_json`](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/api-reference/autogen/config_list_from_json#config-list-from-json)
function loads a list of configurations from an environment variable or
a json file.

```python
import autogen

config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "model": ["gpt-4o-mini"],
    },
)

llm_config = {
    "cache_seed": 42,  # change the cache_seed for different trials
    "temperature": 1,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "timeout": 120,
    "tools": [],
}

assert config_list, "No LLM found for the given model"
```


```python
realtime_config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(
    "OAI_CONFIG_LIST",
    filter_dict={
        "tags": ["gpt-4o-mini-realtime"],
    },
)

realtime_llm_config = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "config_list": realtime_config_list,
    "temperature": 0.8,
}

assert realtime_config_list, (
    "No LLM found for the given model, please add the following lines to the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file:"
    """
    {
        "model": "gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
        "api_key": "sk-***********************...*",
        "tags": ["gpt-4o-mini-realtime", "realtime"]
    }"""
)
```

## Define Agents and register functions

```python
from autogen import ConversableAgent, OnCondition, register_hand_off

# Triage Agent
triage_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="Triage_Agent",
    system_message=triage_instructions(context_variables=context_variables),
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[non_flight_enquiry],
)

# Flight Modification Agent
flight_modification = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Modification_Agent",
    system_message="""You are a Flight Modification Agent for a customer service airline.
      Your task is to determine if the user wants to cancel or change their flight.
      Use message history and ask clarifying questions as needed to decide.
      Once clear, call the appropriate transfer function.""",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

# Flight Cancel Agent
flight_cancel = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Cancel_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + FLIGHT_CANCELLATION_POLICY,
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[initiate_refund, initiate_flight_credits, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)

# Flight Change Agent
flight_change = ConversableAgent(
    name="Flight_Change_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + FLIGHT_CHANGE_POLICY,
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[valid_to_change_flight, change_flight, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)

# Lost Baggage Agent
lost_baggage = ConversableAgent(
    name="Lost_Baggage_Traversal",
    system_message=STARTER_PROMPT + LOST_BAGGAGE_POLICY,
    llm_config=llm_config,
    functions=[initiate_baggage_search, case_resolved, escalate_to_agent],
)
```

### Register Handoffs

Now we register the handoffs for the agents. Note that you don’t need to
define the transfer functions and pass them in. Instead, you can
directly register the handoffs using the `OnCondition` class.

```python
# Register hand-offs
register_hand_off(
    agent=triage_agent,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(flight_modification, "To modify a flight"),
        OnCondition(lost_baggage, "To find lost baggage"),
    ],
)

register_hand_off(
    agent=flight_modification,
    hand_to=[
        OnCondition(flight_cancel, "To cancel a flight"),
        OnCondition(flight_change, "To change a flight"),
    ],
)

transfer_to_triage_description = "Call this function when a user needs to be transferred to a different agent and a different policy.\nFor instance, if a user is asking about a topic that is not handled by the current agent, call this function."
for agent in [flight_modification, flight_cancel, flight_change, lost_baggage]:
    register_hand_off(agent=agent, hand_to=OnCondition(triage_agent, transfer_to_triage_description))
```

### Before you start the server

To run uviconrn server inside the notebook, you will need to use
nest_asyncio. This is because Jupyter uses the asyncio event loop, and
uvicorn uses its own event loop. nest_asyncio will allow uvicorn to run
in Jupyter.

Please install nest_asyncio by running the following cell.

```python
!pip install nest_asyncio
```


```python
import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

# Running the Code

**Note**: You may need to expose your machine to the internet through a
tunnel, such as one provided by [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

This code sets up the FastAPI server for the RealtimeAgent, enabling it
to handle real-time voice interactions through Twilio. By executing this
code, you’ll start the server and make it accessible for testing voice
calls.

Here’s what happens when you run the code:

1.  **Server Initialization**: A FastAPI application is started, ready
    to process requests and WebSocket connections.  
2.  **Incoming Call Handling**: The `/incoming-call` route processes
    incoming calls from Twilio, providing a TwiML response to connect
    the call to a real-time AI assistant.  
3.  **WebSocket Integration**: The `/media-stream` WebSocket endpoint
    bridges the connection between Twilio’s media stream and OpenAI’s
    Realtime API through the RealtimeAgent.  
4.  **RealtimeAgent Configuration**: The RealtimeAgent registers a swarm
    of agents (e.g., `triage_agent`, `flight_modification`) to handle
    complex tasks during the call.

# How to Execute

1.  **Run the Code**: Execute the provided code block in your Python
    environment (such as a Jupyter Notebook or directly in a Python
    script).  
2.  **Start the Server**: The server will listen for requests on port
    `5050`. You can access the root URL (`http://localhost:5050/`) to
    confirm the server is running.  
3.  **Connect Twilio**: Use a tool like **ngrok** to expose the server
    to the public internet, then configure Twilio to route calls to the
    public URL.

Once the server is running, you can connect a Twilio phone call to the
AI assistant and test the RealtimeAgent’s capabilities!
