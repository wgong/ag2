title: Pre-commit
---

Run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit into your git hooks. Before you commit, run
`pre-commit run` to check if you meet the pre-commit requirements. If you use Windows (without WSL) and can't commit after installing pre-commit, you can run `pre-commit uninstall` to uninstall the hook. In WSL or Linux this is supposed to work.
