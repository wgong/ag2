`DeepResearchAgent` helps break down complex tasks into smaller steps,
using web scraping and other techniques to find the information you
need. Instead of handling everything at once, it tackles each part step
by step, making research easier and more efficient. Whether you’re
looking for specific details, gathering data, or just trying to solve a
tricky problem, this agent does the heavy lifting for you.

## Installation

**Note:** `DeepResearchAgent` is built on top of
[`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), which
requires **Python 3.11 or higher**.

To get started with the `DeepResearchAgent` agent, follow these steps:

1.  Install AG2 with the `browser-use` extra:

    ```bash
    pip install ag2[browser-use]
    ```

    > **Note:** If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you
    > need to do is upgrade it using:
    >
    > ```bash
    > pip install -U autogen[browser-use]
    > ```
    >
    > or
    >
    > ```bash
    > pip install -U pyautogen[browser-use]
    > ```
    >
    > as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI
    > package.

2.  Set up Playwright:

    ```bash
    # Installs Playwright and browsers for all OS
    playwright install
    # Additional command, mandatory for Linux only
    playwright install-deps
    ```

3.  For running the code in Jupyter, use `nest_asyncio` to allow nested
    event loops. `bash     pip install nest_asyncio`

You’re all set! Now you can start solving complex tasks.

### Imports

```python
import os

import nest_asyncio

from autogen.agents.experimental import DeepResearchAgent

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

## Starting the Conversation

This code initializes `DeepResearchAgent` and asks it to find out
`What was the impact of DeepSeek on stock prices and why?` using
`GPT-4o`.

> **Note:** Models like `gpt-4o-mini` often don’t perform well enough
> for complex tasks.

```python
llm_config = {
    "config_list": [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}],
}

agent = DeepResearchAgent(
    name="DeepResearchAgent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

message = "What was the impact of DeepSeek on stock prices and why?"

result = agent.run(
    message=message,
    tools=agent.tools,
    max_turns=2,
    user_input=False,
    summary_method="reflection_with_llm",
)

result.summary
```
