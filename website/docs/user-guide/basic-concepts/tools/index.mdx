Agents in AG2 leverage tools to extend their functionality, allowing them to interact with external systems, fetch real-time data, and execute complex tasks beyond the scope of a language model's internal knowledge. This enables a structured approach where agents decide which tool to use and then execute it accordingly.

## How Tool Usage Works in AG2

In AG2, tool execution follows a two-step process:
1. **Selection**: An agent (driven by its LLM) decides which tool is appropriate based on the given task.
2. **Execution**: A separate executor agent invokes the tool and returns the results.

To ensure smooth execution, AG2 enforces a structure where the **executor agent** follows the **selector agent** in a conversation flow.

## Secure Tool Usage with Secrets

When tools require sensitive information like API keys or credentials, AG2 employs **dependency injection** to keep such data secure. This method ensures that private information is not exposed to the LLM while still allowing seamless execution of agent tasks. Some key benefits include:
- **Enhanced Security**: Keeps secrets out of LLM interactions and telemetry.
- **Simplified Development**: Securely passes credentials without hardcoding them.
- **Flexible Integration**: Allows agents to access necessary credentials while maintaining security.

## Interoperability with External Frameworks

AG2 supports interoperability with popular LLM tool frameworks, making it easier to integrate a wide range of tools:
- **LangChain**: Provides numerous pre-built tools for API calls, web scraping, and more.
- **CrewAI**: Offers specialized tools for web scraping, search, and automation.
- **PydanticAI**: Supports structured data handling and dependency injection for context-driven tool execution.

Each of these frameworks can be easily installed and configured to work with AG2, allowing developers to enhance their agents with powerful capabilities.
