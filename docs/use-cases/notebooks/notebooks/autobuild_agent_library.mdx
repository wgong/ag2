In this notebook, we introduce a new feature for AutoBuild,
`build_from_library`, which help users build an automatic task-solving
process powered by a multi-agent system from a pre-defined agent
library. Specifically, in `build_from_library`, we prompt an LLM to
explore useful agents from a pre-defined agent library, generating
configurations for those agents for a group chat to solve the user’s
task.

## Requirement

AutoBuild require `autogen[autobuild]`, which can be installed by the
following command:

```python
%pip install autogen[autobuild]
```

## Preparation and useful tools

We need to specify a `config_path`, `default_llm_config` that include
backbone LLM configurations.

```python
import json

import autogen
from autogen.agentchat.contrib.agent_builder import AgentBuilder

config_file_or_env = "OAI_CONFIG_LIST"  # modify path
llm_config = {"temperature": 0}
config_list = autogen.config_list_from_json(config_file_or_env, filter_dict={"model": ["gpt-4-1106-preview", "gpt-4"]})


def start_task(execution_task: str, agent_list: list):
    group_chat = autogen.GroupChat(agents=agent_list, messages=[], max_round=12)
    manager = autogen.GroupChatManager(groupchat=group_chat, llm_config={"config_list": config_list, **llm_config})
    agent_list[0].initiate_chat(manager, message=execution_task)
```

## Example for generating an agent library

Here, we show an example of generating an agent library from a
pre-defined list of agents’ names by prompting a `gpt-4`. You can also
prepare a handcrafted library yourself.

A Library contains each agent’s name, description and system_message.
The description is a brief introduction about agent’s characteristics.
As we will feed all agents’ names and description to gpt-4 and let it
choose the best agents for us, each agent’s description should be simple
but informative.

First, we define a prompt template for description and system_message
generation and a list of agents’ name:

```python
AGENT_SYS_MSG_PROMPT = """According to the following position name, write a high quality instruction for the position following a given example. You should only return the instruction.

# Position Name
{position}

# Example instruction for Data Analyst

As Data Analyst, you are tasked with leveraging your extensive knowledge in data analysis to recognize and extract meaningful features from vast datasets. Your expertise in machine learning, specifically with the Random Forest Classifier, allows you to construct robust predictive models adept at handling both classification and regression tasks. You excel in model evaluation and interpretation, ensuring that the performance of your algorithms is not just assessed with precision, but also understood in the context of the data and the problem at hand. With a command over Python and proficiency in using the pandas library, you manipulate and preprocess data with ease.
"""

AGENT_DESC_PROMPT = """According to position name and the instruction, summarize the position into a high quality one sentence description.

# Position Name
{position}

# Instruction
{instruction}
"""

position_list = [
    "Environmental_Scientist",
    "Astronomer",
    "Software_Developer",
    "Data_Analyst",
    "Journalist",
    "Teacher",
    "Lawyer",
    "Programmer",
    "Accountant",
    "Mathematician",
    "Physicist",
    "Biologist",
    "Chemist",
    "Statistician",
    "IT_Specialist",
    "Cybersecurity_Expert",
    "Artificial_Intelligence_Engineer",
    "Financial_Analyst",
]
```

Then we can prompt a `gpt-4` model to generate each agent’s system
message as well as the description:

```python
build_manager = autogen.OpenAIWrapper(config_list=config_list)
sys_msg_list = []

for pos in position_list:
    resp_agent_sys_msg = (
        build_manager.create(
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": AGENT_SYS_MSG_PROMPT.format(
                        position=pos,
                    ),
                }
            ]
        )
        .choices[0]
        .message.content
    )
    resp_desc_msg = (
        build_manager.create(
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": AGENT_DESC_PROMPT.format(
                        position=pos,
                        instruction=resp_agent_sys_msg,
                    ),
                }
            ]
        )
        .choices[0]
        .message.content
    )
    sys_msg_list.append({"name": pos, "system_message": resp_agent_sys_msg, "description": resp_desc_msg})
```

The generated profile will have the following format:

```python
sys_msg_list
```

We can save the generated agents’ information into a json file.

```python
json.dump(sys_msg_list, open("./agent_library_example.json", "w"), indent=4)  # noqa: SIM115
```

## Build agents from library (by LLM)

Here, we introduce how to build agents from the generated library. As in
the previous `build`, we also need to specify a `building_task` that
lets the build manager know which agents should be selected from the
library according to the task.

We also need to specify a `library_path_or_json`, which can be a path of
library or a JSON string with agents’ configs. Here, we use the
previously saved path as the library path.

```python
library_path_or_json = "./agent_library_example.json"
building_task = "Find a paper on arxiv by programming, and analyze its application in some domain. For example, find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software."
```

Then, we can call the `build_from_library` from the AgentBuilder to
generate a list of agents from the library and let them complete the
user’s `execution_task` in a group chat.

```python
new_builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model="gpt-4-1106-preview", agent_model="gpt-4-1106-preview"
)
agent_list, _ = new_builder.build_from_library(building_task, library_path_or_json, llm_config)
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about explainable AI on arxiv and find its potential applications in medical.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
)
new_builder.clear_all_agents()
```

## Build agents from library (by description-task similarity)

We also support using embedding similarity to select agents. You can use
a [Sentence-Transformers
model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html)
as an embedding extractor, and AgentBuilder will select agents with
profiles that are the most similar to the building task from the library
by comparing their embedding similarity. This will reduce the use of
LLMs but may have less accuracy.

```python
new_builder = AgentBuilder(
    config_file_or_env=config_file_or_env, builder_model="gpt-4-1106-preview", agent_model="gpt-4-1106-preview"
)
agent_list, _ = new_builder.build_from_library(
    building_task, library_path_or_json, llm_config, embedding_model="all-mpnet-base-v2"
)
start_task(
    execution_task="Find a recent paper about gpt-4 on arxiv and find its potential applications in software.",
    agent_list=agent_list,
)
new_builder.clear_all_agents()
```
