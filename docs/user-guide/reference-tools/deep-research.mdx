We are excited to unveil [`DeepResearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/DeepResearchTool), a powerful autonomous research capability within our **AG2** framework. Inspired by [OpenAI's Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research), our tool is designed to tackle complex, multi-step research tasks efficiently, synthesizing insights from diverse online sources.
