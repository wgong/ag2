### Installation

<Warning>
[`DeepResearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/DeepResearchTool) is built on top of [`Browser Use`](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use), which requires **Python 3.11 or higher**.
</Warning>

To get started with the [`DeepResearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/DeepResearchTool), follow these steps:

1. Install AG2 with the `browser-use` extra:
    ```bash
    pip install ag2[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    <Tip>
    If you have been using `autogen` or `pyautogen`, all you need to do is upgrade it using:
    ```bash
    pip install -U autogen[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    pip install -U pyautogen[openai,browser-use]
    ```
    as `pyautogen`, `autogen`, and `ag2` are aliases for the same PyPI package.
    </Tip>
2. Set up Playwright:

    ```bash
    # Installs Playwright and browsers for all OS
    playwright install
    # Additional command, mandatory for Linux only
    playwright install-deps
    ```

3. For running the code in Jupyter, use `nest_asyncio` to allow nested event loops.
    ```bash
    pip install nest_asyncio
    ```

You're all set! Now you can start using browsing features in AG2.

### Imports

```python
import os
import nest_asyncio

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent
from autogen.tools.experimental import DeepResearchTool

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

### Agent Configuration

Configure the agents for the interaction.

- `config_list` defines the LLM configurations, including the model and API key.
- [`UserProxyAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/UserProxyAgent) simulates user inputs without requiring actual human interaction (set to `NEVER`).
- [`AssistantAgent`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/AssistantAgent) represents the AI agent, configured with the LLM settings.

```python
config_list = [{"api_type": "openai", "model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

llm_config = {
    "config_list": config_list,
}

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", human_input_mode="NEVER")
assistant = AssistantAgent(name="assistant", llm_config=llm_config)
```

### DeepResearchTool Configuration

Once the [`DeepResearchTool`](/docs/api-reference/autogen/tools/experimental/DeepResearchTool) is created, it needs to be registered to the agents.

```python
deep_research_tool = DeepResearchTool(
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

deep_research_tool.register_for_execution(user_proxy)
deep_research_tool.register_for_llm(assistant)
```

### Initiate Chat

```python
result = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    recipient=assistant,
    message="What was the impact of DeepSeek on stock prices and why?",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

```console
user_proxy (to assistant):

DeepSeek search technology significantly impacted stock prices, particularly in the technology sector, by introducing increased market volatility and substantial fluctuations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Overview
- **Impact of DeepSeek**: This AI-driven search technology from China caused disruptions in financial markets, particularly affecting U.S. tech stocks. Its introduction led to massive market capitalization losses, as seen in a trillion-dollar reduction in the Nasdaq index, heavily composed of tech companies.

### How DeepSeek Functions
- **Cost-Effectiveness and Innovation**: DeepSeek's V3 version introduced a highly cost-effective AI model that challenged the existing dominance of international tech firms. This led investors to reevaluate their holdings in these companies, fearing DeepSeek's potential to capture significant market share.

### Changes in Stock Prices
- **Tech Sector Impact**: The technology sector witnessed massive sell-offs, with companies like Nvidia facing severe drops in stock value. The overall tech industry lost billions of dollars following the DeepSeek announcements.
- **Software Stocks**: Some software stocks, perceived as beneficiaries of this shift, experienced positive investor sentiment contrary to other declining AI stocks.

### Mechanisms Influencing Stock Prices
1. **Market Erosion**: DeepSeek’s operational cost advantages and open-source nature disrupted major AI competitors, eroding their market share and prompting a reevaluation of tech stock valuations.
2. **Valuation Reassessments**: Concerns over tech stock valuations heightened market anxiety, driven by competitive threats from DeepSeek.

### Conclusion
Overall, DeepSeek challenged tech giants globally, leading to valuation adjustments and increased stock market volatility. This necessitated a broader reassessment of the technological landscape by investors, culminating in significant financial impacts.

This comprehensive understanding explains the observed effects on stock prices due to DeepSeek. TERMINATE
