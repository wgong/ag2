    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool, or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce a new class, `AgentBuilder`, to help user build an automatic task solving process powered by multi-agent system. Specifically, in `build()`, we prompt a LLM to create multiple participant agent and initialize a group chat, and specify whether this task need programming to solve. AgentBuilder also support open-source LLMs by [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html) and [Fastchat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat). Check the supported model list [here](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html)."
