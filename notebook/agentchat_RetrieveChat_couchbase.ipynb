    "# Using RetrieveChat Powered by Couchbase Capella for Retrieve Augmented Code Generation and Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",
    "Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "RetrieveChat is a conversational system for retrieval-augmented code generation and question answering. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize RetrieveChat to generate code and answer questions based on customized documentations that are not present in the LLM's training dataset. RetrieveChat uses the `AssistantAgent` and `RetrieveUserProxyAgent`, which is similar to the usage of `AssistantAgent` and `UserProxyAgent` in other notebooks (e.g., [Automated Task Solving with Code Generation, Execution & Debugging](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/blob/main/notebook/agentchat_auto_feedback_from_code_execution.ipynb)). Essentially, `RetrieveUserProxyAgent` implement a different auto-reply mechanism corresponding to the RetrieveChat prompts.\n",

    "- To setup a free operational cluster, Head over [Couchbase Cloud](https://cloud.couchbase.com) and create an account. Over there create a free cluster. For more details on creating a cluster, [refer here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/create-account.html).\n",

    "- Now, we will connect to the cluster. [Refer this page for connection](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/get-started/connect.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, let's create user to connect. Head over to settings tab. Click [Create Cluster Access]. Specify a username and password and give read/write all buckets access. You may create more users with less than admin access. For more information, [refer here](https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html#create-database-credentials)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Let's fill our environment variables. First get the connection string from the [Connect] Tab. Now we will have 3 envs for Couchbase cluster and one for open AI\n",
