    "TODO: reimplement the society of mind agent using `register_nested_chat` and move to the core library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the SocietyOfMindAgent, which runs a group chat as an internal monologue, but appears to the external world as a single agent. This confers three distinct advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It provides a clean way of producing a hierarchy of agents, hiding complexity as inner monologues.\n",
    "2. It provides a consistent way of extracting an answer from a lengthy group chat (normally, it is not clear which message is the final response, and the response itself may not always be formatted in a way that makes sense when extracted as a standalone message).\n",
    "3. It provides a way of recovering when agents exceed their context window constraints (the inner monologue is protected by try-catch blocks)\n",

    "In this example, we will use an AssistantAgent and a UserProxy agent (configured for code execution) to work together to solve a problem. Executing code requires *at least* two conversation turns (one to write the code, and one to execute the code). If the code fails, or needs further refinement, then additional turns may also be needed. We will then wrap these agents in a SocietyOfMindAgent, hiding the internal discussion from other agents (though will still appear in the console), and ensuring that the response is suitable as a standalone message."
