    "AG2 offers conversable agents powered by LLMs, tools, or humans, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The current GroupChat class allows transitioning to any agent (with or without the decision of the LLM), some use cases might demand for more control over transition. A graph is a possible way to control the transition paths, where each node represents an agent and each directed edge represents possible transition paths. Let's illustrate the current transition paths for a GroupChat with five agents."
