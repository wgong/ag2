In this notebook we introduce send and retrieve message tools for 3
messaging platforms: Discord, Slack, and Telegram.

These tools can be added to your AG2 agents, enabling them to send
messages during a workflow and/or retrieve messages for use by the
workflow.

There are two types of tools, with one for each platform:

-   Sending a message (`DiscordSendTool`, `SlackSendTool`,
    `TelegramSendTool`)
-   Retrieving messages (`DiscordRetrieveTool`, `SlackRetrieveTool`,
    `TelegramRetrieveTool`)

You can attach one or more of them to an agent, though it may be most
typical that you create an agent for each platform and attach their
respective send and/or retrieve tools. This would allow you to tailor
your system message for your agent to the messaging style used for the
platform.


<div class="note">
<Note>
These tools are currently in our `experimental` namespace, indicating that we have tested the functionality but they have not been confirmed for use in production. Please use them with that in mind and we appreciate any feedback on them.

If you do find any bugs please [log an issue](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/issues) in the AG2 repository. If you would like to add more tools or functionality, we would love your [contribution](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/contributor-guide/contributing).
</Note>
</div>


## Installation

Each messaging platform requires installation of a package specifically
for that platform.

To use the Discord tools install AG2 with the `commsagent-discord`
extra:

```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-discord]
```

Similarly, for slack and telegram:

```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-slack]
```

and

```bash
pip install ag2[commsagent-telegram]
```

You’re all set! Now you can start sending to and retrieving messages
from these platforms.

### LLM Configuration

The examples in this notebook will use OpenAI’s `GPT-4o mini` model. As
OpenAI is the default model provider in AG2 and the `OPENAI_API_TOKEN`
will be retrieved from environment variables, we can use an LLM
configuration as follows:

```python
llm_config = {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
```

For further information on LLM configurations and how to set your
environment variables up, check out our [Basic Concepts
guide](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/user-guide/basic-concepts/llm-configuration).

### Protecting details from the LLM

These tools utilise dependency injection to protect your authentication
and channel/group details from being sent to the LLM.

For more about AG2’s dependency injection, see [this
notebook](https://docs.ag2.ai/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/tools_dependency_injection).

## Discord Send/Retrieve Messages

### Tokens, Guilds, and Channels

The Discord tools, `DiscordSendTool` and `DiscordRetrieveTool`, require
authentication (bot token), server (guild name), and channel details in
order to send/retrieve messages.

Here are some references to help you establish those details:

-   [Creating a Bot
    Account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html),
    and [another
    reference](https://gist.github.com/SinisterRectus/2d84025f51bc0be37d2f0d0c559c2e35#how-do-i-make-a-discord-bot)
-   [Adding a Bot to a
    server](https://gist.github.com/SinisterRectus/2d84025f51bc0be37d2f0d0c559c2e35#how-do-i-add-a-discord-bot-to-my-server)
-   Bot Permissions you will need:
    -   General Permissions: View Channels
    -   Text Permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History, Use Slash
        Commands
-   Server/Guild Name - Right-click the Server \> Server Settings \>
    Overview, see the Server Name at the top right (e.g. “My Test
    Server”)
-   Channel name - The text after the hash (e.g. “general”)

### Sending and retrieving messages with Discord

Let’s add the Discord Send and Retrieve tools to an agent and have them
executed by another agent in a simple 2-agent chat.

```python
# Tools are available in the autogen.tools namespace
from autogen import ConversableAgent
from autogen.tools.experimental import DiscordRetrieveTool, DiscordSendTool

llm_config = {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
```

Create our two agents.

```python
# Our tool executor agent, which will run the tools once recommended by the discord_agent, no LLM required
executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="executor_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

# Our discord agent, who will construct messages and recommend the tool calls
discord_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="discord_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

Prepare our authentication, server/guild, channel details, then create
our tools, and finally register them with the agents.

```python
_bot_token = "MTMyOTI..."  # Discord bot token
_guild_name = "My Test Server"  # Name of the server
_channel_name = "general"  # Name of the channel, this is equivalent to "# general"

# Create our send tool
discord_send_tool = DiscordSendTool(bot_token=_bot_token, guild_name=_guild_name, channel_name=_channel_name)

# Register it for recommendation by our Discord agent
discord_send_tool.register_for_llm(discord_agent)

# Register it for execution by our executor agent
discord_send_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)

# And the same for our our retrieve tool
discord_retrieve_tool = DiscordRetrieveTool(bot_token=_bot_token, guild_name=_guild_name, channel_name=_channel_name)
discord_retrieve_tool.register_for_llm(discord_agent)
discord_retrieve_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)
```

Let’s send a message to Discord, all about the wonders of Australia.

We’ll limit it to 2 turns, allowing the Discord agent to receive the
request, construct and recommend the send tool, and then the executor
agent to execute the tool, sending the message to Discord.

```python
executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=discord_agent,
    message="Let's send a message to Discord giving them a paragraph on the highlights of Australia.",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

And here’s the message it sent:

![](./commsplatforms_discord_sentmsg.png)

And the output:

```console
executor_agent (to discord_agent):

Let's send a message to Discord giving them a paragraph on the highlights of Australia.

## Slack Send/Retrieve Messages

### Tokens and Channels

The Slack tools, `SlackSendTool` and `SlackRetrieveTool`, require
authentication (OAuth token) and channel details in order to
send/retrieve messages.

Here are the steps to get a token:

-   Create an app, from scratch, at https://api.slack.com/apps
-   In your app settings, go to Features \> OAuth & Permissions:
    -   Under “Bot Token Scopes”, add these permissions:
        -   chat:write (to send messages)
        -   channels:history
        -   channels:read (to access channel info)
        -   groups:read (for private channels)
        -   im:read (for direct messages)
        -   users:read (to get user info)
        -   files:read (to access file attachments)
        -   groups:history
        -   im:history
        -   mpim:history
-   With your app setup, now install it in your workspace, using the
    “Install App” menu, to create an OAuth Token.

To get the ID for your channel:

-   Open Slack in a browser
-   Navigate to your channel
-   Get the channel ID from the URL (e.g., …/C12345678)

Finally you need to add the bot to your channel:

-   In Slack, go to your channel
-   Type `/invite @YourBotName`, e.g. `/invite @ag2commsagent`

Now you should be good to go with your OAuth token, channel ID, and a
bot on your channel ready to send and retrieve messages!

### Sending and retrieving messages with Slack

Let’s add the Slack Send and Retrieve tools to an agent and have them
executed by another agent in as simple 2-agent chat.

This time, we’ll include a weather tool so that we can send a weather
forecast.

```python
# Tools are available in the autogen.tools namespace
from autogen import ConversableAgent, register_function
from autogen.tools.experimental import SlackRetrieveTool, SlackSendTool

llm_config = {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
```

Create our two agents.

```python
# Our tool executor agent, which will run the tools once recommended by the slack_agent, no LLM required
executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="executor_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

slack_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="slack_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

Prepare our authentication and channel details, then create our tools,
and finally register them with the agents.

```python
_bot_token = "xoxo..."  # OAuth token
_channel_id = "C1234567"  # ID of the Slack channel

# Create our send tool
slack_send_tool = SlackSendTool(bot_token=_bot_token, channel_id=_channel_id)

# Register it for recommendation by our Slack agent
slack_send_tool.register_for_llm(slack_agent)

# Register it for execution by our executor agent
slack_send_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)

# And the same for our our retrieve tool
slack_retrieve_tool = SlackRetrieveTool(bot_token=_bot_token, channel_id=_channel_id)
slack_retrieve_tool.register_for_llm(slack_agent)
slack_retrieve_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)
```

Here’s our weather tool and we’ll register it to the two agents, but
this time using the `register_function` method to do it in one go.

```python
# Weather function
def get_weather():
    return "The weather today is 25 degrees Celsius and sunny, with a late storm."


register_function(
    get_weather,
    caller=slack_agent,
    executor=executor_agent,
    description="Get the current weather forecast",
)
```

Let’s send a message to Slack, giving everyone a weather forecast for
today.

We’ll limit it to 3 turns, allowing the Slack agent to receive the
request, recommend the weather tool, and go around the agents and then
construct and recommend the send tool. The executor agent will execute
each tool request.

```python
executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=slack_agent,
    message="Get the latest weather forecast and send it to our Slack channel. Use some emojis to make it fun!",
    max_turns=3,
)
```

And here’s the message it sent:

![](commsplatforms_slack_sentmsg.png)

And the output:

```console
executor_agent (to slack_agent):

Get the latest weather forecast and send it to our Slack channel. Use some emojis to make it fun!

## Telegram Send/Retrieve Messages

### Tokens, Bots, Groups, and Channels

The Telegram tools, `TelegramSendTool` and `TelegramRetrieveTool`,
require authentication (API ID and hash) and target Bot/Group/Channel
details in order to send/retrieve messages.

The Telegram tool is different to the Discord and Slack tools in that
you can send/retrieve messages to/from a bot channel, a group channel, a
channel, or even your own private channel. This is all handled by giving
the respective ID to the `chat_id` parameter when creating the tool.

Here’s how to establish your API ID and Hash: - [API ID and
Hash](https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/basic/signing-in.html)

If you want to create a bot, which is optional but allows you to send
messages to the bot channel: - In Telegram, search for
(**BotFather?**) - Click on (**BotFather?**) (make sure it’s the correct
one!) and click START - Message `/newbot` - Give it a name then a
username - You’ll then receive a token for your bot and you see the
links below to get the ID for your bot

There are four types of `chat_id`s you can send to: - Bot chat - Group
chat - Channel chat - Private chat (noted in Telegram as
`Saved Messages`)

To find these the IDs for these, here are some references: - [Bot,
Private, Channel, Group
IDs](https://gist.github.com/nafiesl/4ad622f344cd1dc3bb1ecbe468ff9f8a) -
[Group and Channel
IDs](https://docs.b2core.b2broker.com/how-to-articles/manage-communication-platforms/how-to-get-telegram-chat-group-and-channel-identifiers) -
[Group
ID](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32423837/telegram-bot-how-to-get-a-group-chat-id)

It takes a bit of time to get this sorted, but once you have your token
and IDs, you’re ready to go!


<div class="note">
<Note>
You may be prompted for Telegram verification during the AG2 chat session. This typically happens when you first run it and is not required during subsequent runs.
</Note>
</div>


### Sending and retrieving messages with Telegram

Let’s add the Telegram Send and Retrieve tools to an agent and have them
executed by another agent in as simple 2-agent chat.

```python
# Tools are available in the autogen.tools namespace
from autogen import ConversableAgent
from autogen.tools.experimental import TelegramRetrieveTool, TelegramSendTool

llm_config = {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
```

Create our two agents.

```python
# Our tool executor agent, which will run the tools once recommended by the telegram_agent, no LLM required
executor_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="executor_agent",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
)

telegram_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="telegram_agent",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)
```

Prepare our authentication and target chat id details, then create our
tools, and finally register them with the agents.

For this send, we’ll send it to a group using the group’s ID in our
`chat_id`.

```python
# Authentication and target Chat ID (in this case a Group chat)
api_id = "123....."
api_hash = "a2e............................."
_chat_id_group = "-4712345678"

# Create our send tool
telegram_send_tool = TelegramSendTool(api_id=api_id, api_hash=api_hash, chat_id=_chat_id_group)

# Register it for recommendation by our Telegram agent
telegram_send_tool.register_for_llm(telegram_agent)

# Register it for execution by our executor agent
telegram_send_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)

# And the same for our our retrieve tool
telegram_retrieve_tool = TelegramRetrieveTool(api_id=api_id, api_hash=api_hash, chat_id=_chat_id_group)
telegram_retrieve_tool.register_for_llm(telegram_agent)
telegram_retrieve_tool.register_for_execution(executor_agent)
```

Let’s send a message to our Telegram channel, with a joke for the day.

We’ll limit it to 2 turns, allowing the Telegram agent to receive the
request, construct and recommend the send tool, and then the executor
agent to execute the tool, sending the message to the Telegram group.

```python
executor_agent.initiate_chat(
    recipient=telegram_agent,
    message="Let's send a message to Telegram giving them a joke for the day about AI agentic frameworks",
    max_turns=2,
)
```

And here’s the joke message it sent:

<img src="/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/commsplatforms_telegram_sentmsg.png" alt="Telegram message" />

And the output:

```console
executor_agent (to telegram_agent):
